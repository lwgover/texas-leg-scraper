1870582	TX	HB47	Relating to sexual assault and other sex offenses.	AN ACT relating to sexual assault and other sex offenses.	This bill proposes several comprehensive changes to improve support and protections for sexual assault survivors in Texas. It expands medical care and reimbursement provisions to cover prescribed continuing medical care related to sexual assault for up to 30 days following a forensic medical examination, ensuring survivors receive more comprehensive treatment. The bill extends victims' rights across multiple legal and health systems, including juvenile justice and healthcare facilities, and requires more detailed information to be provided to survivors about their rights, available services, and resources. It also introduces new training requirements for healthcare professionals, mandating that physicians and physician assistants complete continuing education on trauma-informed care, forensic evidence collection, and sexual assault survivors' rights. Additionally, the bill modifies regulations for transportation network companies by requiring background checks that include state sex offender registries and extends restrictions on registered sex offenders working in certain transportation services. The legislation also increases reporting requirements for sexual assault response teams and connects these reports to a statewide task force, potentially improving tracking and understanding of sexual assault incidents. Most provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, with some specific requirements having later implementation dates to allow for rule-making and preparation.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	10	1	0	81	2	Donna Howard (D)*, Tom Oliverson (R)*	Biennial Summary Detailing, Dna Profiles Maintained, Federal Dna Database, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Receiving Grant Funds, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Task Force Established, Guilty Plea Negotiations, Plea Bargain Agreement, Defense-Initiated Victim Outreach	Justice	103	Reported favorably w/o amendment(s)	04/08/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB47	True	03/14/2025	03/15/2025	Pro LGBT

"This bill modifies Texas health code to establish an opt-out approach for screening tests related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Specifically, the bill defines a ""screening test"" as a rapid laboratory procedure to determine the need for further diagnostic evaluation of an infection. Under the new provisions, when a healthcare provider collects a blood sample during a medical screening for an STD, they must inform the patient about the screening test and obtain consent, with the test being automatically performed unless the patient explicitly opts out. If a screening test returns a positive result, the healthcare provider is required to provide the patient with information about available healthcare, education, prevention, and social support services. The executive commissioner of the Health and Human Services Commission is tasked with developing implementation rules, considering the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. The bill sets January 1, 2026, as the deadline for adopting rules and implementing the new requirements, with a provision that the commission is not obligated to implement the mandatory provisions unless specific funding is appropriated.

AN ACT relating to the adoption of the revised Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children by the State of Texas; making conforming changes.	This bill updates the Texas Family Code to adopt the revised Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC), which provides a comprehensive framework for legally placing children across state lines for foster care, adoption, or residential care. The bill introduces a detailed, multi-article compact that establishes standardized procedures for interstate child placements, including defining key terms, outlining placement evaluation processes, determining jurisdictional responsibilities, and creating an Interstate Commission to oversee the compact's implementation. Key provisions include establishing uniform standards for assessing placement safety, ensuring ongoing supervision of placed children, protecting the legal rights of children and parents, and creating mechanisms for dispute resolution between states. The bill also makes several conforming amendments to existing Texas law, such as updating terminology and references to align with the new compact. The compact aims to protect children's welfare by ensuring thorough assessments, maintaining legal oversight, and facilitating communication between states during interstate child placements. The bill will take effect once the compact is enacted by the 35th state, with some provisions becoming effective earlier.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	16	2	0	68	1	Christian Hayes (D)*	Northern Marianas Islands, Appropriately Assumed Jurisdiction, Child Welfare Program, Develop Uniform Standards, Entire Text Stating, Permanent Duty Station, Relevant Exemption Provision, Roll Call Vote, Accounting Procedures Established, Indian Tribes Notwithstanding	Health and Social Services	44	Placed on General State Calendar	04/16/2025	04/07/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB141	True	03/05/2025	03/06/2025	Pro LGBT
1751944	TX	HB230	Relating to the establishment of the office of community violence intervention and prevention within the Department of State Health Services and a grant program for violence intervention and prevention services.	AN ACT relating to the establishment of the office of community violence intervention and prevention within the Department of State Health Services and a grant program for violence intervention and prevention services.	This bill establishes the Office of Community Violence Intervention and Prevention within the Department of State Health Services, with a comprehensive mission to reduce interpersonal violence through collaborative, evidence-based strategies. The office will coordinate violence prevention efforts across various types of violence, including child abuse, elder abuse, family violence, gun violence, and violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity. A key component of the bill is a competitive grant program that will provide funding to counties, municipalities, and community-based organizations disproportionately impacted by violence, with a focus on implementing initiatives that interrupt cycles of violence without increasing mass incarceration. The office will create a statewide public health campaign, develop a directory of intervention services, and establish an advisory committee that includes members personally impacted by violence, formerly incarcerated individuals, and experts in evidence-based violence reduction strategies. Grant recipients will be required to use funds for programs like hospital-based intervention, community outreach, and focused deterrence strategies, and must report their progress toward achieving grant objectives. The bill mandates the office's establishment by December 1, 2025, with rules to be adopted by the executive commissioner, and it will take effect on September 1, 2025.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	58	3	Jon Rosenthal (D)*, Lauren Simmons (D)*, Gene Wu (D)*	Ecological System Approach, Intimate Partner Violence, Violence Involving Youth, Increasing Public Awareness, Address Regional Problems, Develop Collaborative Relationships, Focused Deterrence Strategies, Office Sufficient Control, Recommend Comprehensive Wraparound, Integrate Violence Intervention	Health and Social Services	57	Referred to Public Health	02/27/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB230	True	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT
1751471	TX	HB270	Relating to civil liability for discriminatory false reports to law enforcement agencies or emergency service providers.	AN ACT relating to civil liability for discriminatory false reports to law enforcement agencies or emergency service providers.	This bill establishes a new legal provision in Texas that allows individuals who have been falsely reported to law enforcement or emergency services due to discriminatory bias to seek civil damages. Specifically, a person who submits a false report with the intent to target someone based on their race, color, disability, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity can be held liable for up to $250 in damages. If the falsely accused person successfully brings a lawsuit under this provision, they would also be entitled to recover their attorney's fees and court costs. The law will only apply to causes of action that arise on or after its effective date of September 1, 2025, meaning it cannot be used for incidents that occurred before that date. This bill aims to provide a legal mechanism to discourage discriminatory false reporting and offer a form of recourse for victims of such malicious and prejudiced actions.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	30	1	Jon Rosenthal (D)*	Emergency Service Provider, Emergency Service Providers, Discriminatory False Reports, Discrimination Sec, False Report, National Origin, Recover Attorney, Remedies Code, Sexual Orientation, Submitted  Due	Justice	25	Referred to Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence	02/27/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB270	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

AN ACT relating to a prohibition of employment discrimination on the basis of reproductive decisions and certain employment agreements limiting reproductive decisions.	"This bill amends the Texas Labor Code to expand employment discrimination protections by adding ""reproductive decisions"" as a protected category across multiple sections of existing law. The bill defines reproductive decisions broadly, including discrimination based on marital status during pregnancy, use of assisted reproduction, use of contraception, and obtaining reproductive healthcare services. The legislation prohibits employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and other employment-related entities from discriminating against individuals because of their reproductive decisions, covering actions such as hiring, firing, compensation, job assignments, and training opportunities. Additionally, the bill requires employers to include information about reproductive decision discrimination in employee handbooks and renders mandatory arbitration agreements void if they attempt to limit an employee's or their family members' reproductive decisions. The bill applies to various employment practices, including job postings, test scoring, and staffing decisions, and extends these protections to employees at different locations and in various work settings. The new provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, and will apply to discrimination claims based on conduct occurring on or after that date, with a specific provision that the prohibition on restrictive arbitration agreements applies to agreements entered into before, on, or after the effective date."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	53	1	Jon Rosenthal (D)*	Mandatory Arbitration Agreement, Previously Exempt Employees, Labor Organization Commits, Employment Agency Commits, Retraining Program Commits, Labor Organization, Employment Agency, Employer Commits, Retraining Opportunity, Retraining Program		59	Referred to s/c on Workforce by Speaker	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB302	True	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT
1751125	TX	HB317	Relating to an employee's right to time off from work if the employee experiences a reproductive loss.	AN ACT relating to an employee's right to time off from work if the employee experiences a reproductive loss.	This bill establishes a new law in Texas that provides employees with the right to take time off from work following a reproductive loss. Specifically, employees who have worked for an employer for at least 30 days are entitled to five days of leave within three months after experiencing a reproductive loss, which includes miscarriage, stillbirth, unsuccessful assisted reproduction procedures, adoption agreement dissolution, or failed embryo transfers. The time off can be taken consecutively or intermittently, and employees can take up to 20 work days of leave if they experience multiple reproductive losses in a 12-month period. Employers are not required to pay employees during this leave and cannot force employees to use other types of accrued leave. Importantly, employers cannot require detailed documentation about the reproductive loss and must maintain the confidentiality of the employee's request. The bill also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who request or take this type of leave, and employers must post a notice informing employees of these rights. Employers who violate these provisions will be considered to have committed an unlawful employment practice. The law will take effect on September 1, 2025, and applies to reproductive losses occurring on or after that date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	34	2	Mary González (D)*, Penny Morales Shaw (D)	Failed Embryo Transfer, Employer Retaliation Prohibited, Reproductive Loss Occurring, Reproductive Loss Resulting, Surrogacy Agreement Entered, Reproductive Loss Sec, Employee Absence Authorized, Reproductive  Loss, Reproductive Loss, Surrogacy Agreement		41	Referred to s/c on Workforce by Speaker	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB317	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

This bill amends the Texas Penal Code to expand and clarify the definitions of sexual assault and circumstances under which consent is not present. The changes include specifying that consent must be actively given through verbal or positive affirmation, and adding several new scenarios where sexual assault can be determined, such as when a person is unaware the act is occurring, incapable of appraising the nature of the act, or has withdrawn consent. The bill also adds provisions addressing scenarios involving impersonation of professionals like public servants, clergy, coaches, tutors, and healthcare providers, and expands protections against sexual assault by individuals in positions of authority or emotional dependency. Additionally, the bill modifies a related section of the Occupations Code to adjust the timeframe for considering complaints related to certain sexual assault violations. The changes will apply only to offenses committed on or after the effective date of September 1, 2025, with previous offenses still governed by the law in effect at the time of the offense.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	8	1	0	28	1	Ann Johnson (D)*	Assisted Reproduction Procedure, Health Care Services, Human Reproductive Material, Intentionally Impaired, Mental Disease, Penal Code, Physically Unable, Positive Affirmation, Public Servant, Sexual Assault	Justice	40	Left pending in committee	03/25/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB324	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

AN ACT relating to the repeal of certain requirements regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at public institutions of higher education.	This bill proposes to repeal Section 51.3525 of the Texas Education Code, which appears to be related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at public higher education institutions. DEI programs are typically designed to promote equal opportunities and representation for historically marginalized groups in educational settings. By repealing this section of the law, the bill would effectively eliminate existing requirements or guidelines about such initiatives at Texas public colleges and universities. The bill includes a standard legislative provision allowing it to take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds majority vote in both legislative chambers, otherwise it will automatically become effective on September 1, 2025. The concise nature of the bill suggests a direct intent to remove existing DEI-related requirements without providing alternative language or frameworks.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	24	1	John Bucy (D)*	Education Code, Higher Education, Inclusion Initiatives, Public Institutions, Diversity, Equity, Relating, Repeal, Requirements, Txhb	Education	160	Referred to Higher Education	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB393	True	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

AN ACT relating to recognizing persons who separated from military service solely on the basis of sexual orientation as honorably discharged veterans under state law.	This bill addresses the historical discrimination against LGBTQ+ service members by establishing a process for individuals who were discharged from military service solely due to their sexual orientation to be recognized as honorably discharged veterans under Texas state law. The bill specifically defines certain military discharge codes (such as BLC, BML, BRA, etc.) that indicate a discharge based on sexual orientation and allows individuals with these codes on their DD Form 214 (a military discharge document) to be reclassified as honorably discharged. By doing so, these veterans will become eligible for all state-level benefits, rights, privileges, and immunities typically afforded to honorably discharged veterans. The bill provides a mechanism for affected service members to have their military service records reinterpreted, effectively rectifying past discriminatory practices that prevented LGBTQ+ individuals from receiving full recognition and benefits for their military service. The provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, giving state agencies time to prepare for implementing these changes.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	14	1	Barbara Gervin-Hawkins (D)*	Alphanumeric Code Found, Military Discharge Record, Military Service Solely, Separation Code Listed, Numeric Code Commonly, Honorably Discharged Veterans, Separation Code, Government Code, Honorably Discharged, Separation Codes	Military Affairs and Security	32	Referred to s/c on Defense & Veterans' Affairs by Speaker	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB450	True	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

This bill amends the Texas Education Code to enhance notification and suicide prevention procedures for parents and guardians when their children are involved in bullying incidents or identified as being at risk of suicide. Specifically, the bill requires school districts and charter schools to maintain a record of parent notifications and provide parents with suicide prevention materials and information on limiting a student's access to potential suicide means, such as firearms or medication. The Texas Education Agency, in coordination with the Health and Human Services Commission, will be responsible for selecting the appropriate suicide prevention materials and information. The new requirements will take effect during the 2025-2026 school year, with the bill becoming effective immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the immediate effect vote.

Currently, registrars are prohibited from refusing to appoint eligible volunteers based on sex, race, creed, color, or national origin or ancestry. The proposed amendment adds sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and political affiliation to this list of protected characteristics. Volunteer deputy voter registrars are individuals who help people register to vote at the local level, and this bill aims to ensure that the appointment process is more inclusive and non-discriminatory.

AN ACT relating to prohibited disqualification of and peremptory challenges to certain prospective jurors.	This bill introduces new legal protections against discriminatory jury selection practices in both civil and criminal cases in Texas. The legislation prohibits attorneys from using peremptory challenges (the ability to exclude potential jurors without stating a specific reason) to remove jurors based on their actual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, national origin, or economic status. If a party believes that such discriminatory challenges have occurred, they can request the court to dismiss the entire jury pool and call a new array. The burden of proof initially lies with the complaining party to provide evidence suggesting discriminatory intent, after which the burden shifts to the challenging attorney to provide a neutral explanation for their strikes. Furthermore, the bill adds a new provision to the Government Code explicitly stating that a person cannot be disqualified from jury service based on the same protected characteristics. These changes aim to ensure a more representative and unbiased jury selection process, promoting fairness in the legal system.

The task force will assess the evolving housing needs of LGBTQ+ seniors, particularly those transitioning to long-term care facilities like assisted living or nursing homes, and develop potential housing solutions. Members will serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. By September 1, 2026, the task force must submit a comprehensive written report to state leadership and the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, including potential housing solutions and legislative recommendations.

School districts and charter schools will have the flexibility to tailor the curriculum to their specific community's needs, but they must seek input from the State Board of Education, the agency, community members, and other interested parties.

AN ACT relating to the establishment of a bullying prevention pilot program for public schools.	This bill establishes a bullying prevention pilot program for Texas public schools, to be administered by the state education agency. Under the proposed legislation, the agency will develop a research-based program using best practices and expertise from child psychology, mental health, and education professionals. The program will involve awarding grants to school districts that demonstrate a significant need for bullying prevention, with selected districts able to implement the program on up to three campuses. The commissioner of education will establish application criteria for grants, determine how grant money can be used, and may seek additional funding through grants or donations.

AN ACT relating to the prohibition of certain discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; providing an administrative penalty.	This bill expands legal protections against discrimination in Texas by adding sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics across multiple areas of state law. Specifically, the bill amends existing laws in civil practice, labor, government contracting, and property codes to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, public accommodations, housing, and state contractor practices. Key provisions include making it unlawful for employers to discriminate in hiring, firing, or job assignments; preventing public accommodations from denying service; requiring state contractors to adopt non-discriminatory employment policies; and adding sexual orientation and gender identity to existing anti-discrimination frameworks in housing and real estate transactions. The bill defines sexual orientation as an individual's actual or perceived heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, and gender identity as an individual's gender-related identity, appearance, or characteristics, regardless of their designated sex at birth. An aggrieved person can file a civil action within two years of a discriminatory practice, with potential remedies including actual and punitive damages, attorney's fees, court costs, and injunctive relief. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and will apply to new contracts, conduct, and complaints from that date forward.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	84	1	Diego Bernal (D)*	Bona Fide Offer, Grant Preferential Treatment, Internal Revenue Code, Administrative Penalty Imposed, Federally Controlled Substance, Force Intentionally Intimidates, Previously Exempt Employees, Employment Agency Commits, Sexual Orientation-Neutral Intervention, Labor Code Apply	Government Affairs	30	Referred to State Affairs	03/04/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB715	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

Specifically, the bill prevents discrimination in activities such as selling or renting dwellings, publishing housing-related advertisements, representing property availability, inducing neighborhood changes, conducting real estate transactions, and providing brokerage services. The bill also adjusts provisions related to religious organizations and appraisals to include the new protected categories. Additionally, it modifies complaint referral processes, ensuring that the Texas Workforce Commission cannot defer proceedings to municipalities that lack laws protecting against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Specifically, it eliminates previous language that prohibited teachers from being compelled to discuss controversial public policy issues and removes specific prohibitions about teaching concepts related to race and sex. The bill also updates provisions for civics training programs for teachers, requiring training in essential social studies skills, guided classroom discussions, governmental process simulations, media literacy, and strategies for incorporating civics instruction across different subjects. Additionally, the bill protects classroom teachers from disciplinary proceedings if they use state-approved instructional materials and deliver instruction with fidelity. The changes will take effect in the 2025-2026 school year, and the bill becomes law either immediately with a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the necessary immediate voting support.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	65	1	Diego Bernal (D)*	Guided Classroom Discussion, Incorporating Civics Instruction, Authentic Founding Principles, Civics Training Programs, Democratic Processes Consistent, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Classroom Teacher Employed, Teacher Delivered Instruction, Instructional Material Included, Public Policy Advocacy	Education	114	Referred to Public Education	03/05/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB781	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

Specifically, the bill amends the Texas Election Code to clarify that an indication of gender on a voter's identification that does not match their current gender expression or identity cannot be used to invalidate the identification for voting purposes. The legislation aims to ensure that transgender voters can more easily exercise their right to vote by preventing discrimination based on gender presentation discrepancies on official identification documents.

It explicitly states that mental health providers, which includes a wide range of licensed professionals such as counselors, psychologists, physicians, and social workers, engage in unprofessional conduct if they attempt to change a child's sexual orientation, eliminate romantic attractions to same-sex individuals, or modify their gender identity or expression. However, the bill provides important exceptions for counseling that offers support, understanding, and identity exploration, as well as interventions to prevent unsafe practices or support gender transition in accordance with established care standards.

This bill requires the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (the department) to establish equitable operations policies for emergency homeless shelters receiving state or federal financial assistance. The policies mandate that shelters eliminate discriminatory practices and ensure equal access to services for individuals experiencing homelessness, regardless of personal characteristics like race, gender identity, or disability. Shelters must provide culturally appropriate services, offer equal access to basic amenities and supportive services, prioritize vulnerable populations, implement trauma-informed care practices, provide staff training on equity and inclusion, and collect demographic data on residents. The department will develop guidelines, monitor shelter compliance, and can withhold financial assistance from shelters that fail to adopt these policies. Local emergency shelter regulatory authorities may assist in implementation, and the state legislature's finance committees will use these policies as a guide for understanding policy costs and funding. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and the department is required to adopt the necessary rules as soon as practicable after the effective date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	42	1	Sheryl Cole (D)*	Provide Staff Training, Emergency Homeless Shelters, Including Federal Funds, Provide Financial Assistance, Equitable Operations Policies, Individual Receiving Services, Safe Sleeping Accommodations, Emergency Homeless Shelter, Emergency Shelter Guidelines, Emergency Shelter	Government Affairs	19	Referred to Intergovernmental Affairs	03/18/2025	02/12/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB2724	False	02/12/2025	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

"This bill updates various sections of the Texas Family Code, Health and Safety Code, and Penal Code to remove gender-specific language and reflect legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The bill makes several key changes, including replacing gender-specific terms like ""husband and wife"" with gender-neutral language such as ""spouses"" or ""individuals"", modifying marriage license application forms to remove gender-specific references, and adding provisions that require gender-specific terminology to be construed neutrally when implementing rights and duties in same-sex marriages. Additionally, the bill removes provisions that previously described homosexual conduct as criminal or unacceptable, specifically repealing Section 21.06 of the Penal Code which criminalized homosexual conduct. The bill also updates references in sections related to parental rights, holiday possession schedules, and health education materials to remove language that stigmatizes same-sex relationships.

The bill applies to a wide range of health benefit plans, including individual and group insurance policies, hospital service contracts, health maintenance organization plans, state Medicaid programs, child health plans, county employee health benefits, and various other health coverage types. The definition of sexual orientation includes actual or perceived sexuality status, and gender identity or expression encompasses a person's gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior that may differ from their assigned sex at birth. The law will take effect on September 1, 2025, and will apply to health benefit plans delivered, issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, effectively preventing health insurance providers from covering conversion therapy practices across multiple types of health plans in Texas.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	69	1	Terry Meza (D)*	Surgical Expenses Incurred, Professional Employer Organization, Similar Coverage Document, Health Care Provider, Franchise Insurance Policy, Health Benefit Plan, Local Government Code, Basic Coverage Plan, Accident Coverage Provided, Including Coverage Provided	Business and Industry	61	Referred to Insurance	03/19/2025	02/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB2784	False	02/13/2025	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

This bill establishes a disease control pilot program in seven Texas counties (Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Harris, Nueces, Travis, and Webb) aimed at reducing the spread of blood-borne infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis B and C. The program allows counties and hospital districts to create anonymous needle exchange initiatives where individuals can trade used hypodermic needles and syringes for new, sterile ones. Registered organizations operating these programs can charge a modest fee for needles and will be required to provide annual reports on the program's effectiveness in reducing disease transmission and drug use. The bill includes provisions to protect program participants and authorized personnel from criminal prosecution related to needle possession, and allows these organizations to solicit funding from various sources. The legislation recognizes that drug addiction is a serious issue and seeks to provide compassionate intervention by offering education, health services, and pathways to substance abuse treatment. The pilot program is designed to protect public health by reducing the risk of disease transmission, preventing needle-stick injuries, and potentially helping individuals struggling with addiction access necessary medical and social services.

The bill specifically allows DEI-related activities only when required by federal law or to fulfill the governing board's mission of ensuring student opportunities.

This bill proposes to repeal Section 51.3525 of the Texas Education Code, which likely pertains to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at public higher education institutions. DEI initiatives are programs and policies designed to promote representation, participation, and fair treatment of diverse groups within educational settings. By completely removing this section of the law, the bill would eliminate existing requirements related to DEI efforts in Texas public colleges and universities. The bill has an immediate effectiveness clause, meaning it will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in both legislative chambers. If it does not receive the required supermajority vote, the bill will become effective on September 1, 2025.

This bill modifies the duties and responsibilities of guardians ad litem, attorneys ad litem, and amicus attorneys in child-related legal proceedings, primarily in cases involving the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. The key changes include requiring these legal representatives to interview the child and relevant parties within specific timeframes (7 business days for initial interviews and 15 business days for comprehensive interviews), lowering the age at which children are directly interviewed from four to three years old, and changing the documentation requirements for older children. The bill also mandates more frequent reviews of a child's safety, well-being, and educational needs, with attorneys required to review these aspects at least monthly. Additionally, the bill clarifies the circumstances under which an attorney can make substituted judgments for a child with intellectual or developmental disabilities, requiring consultation with a guardian ad litem and ensuring that the guardian's perspective is presented to the court. The changes aim to improve the quality of legal representation and advocacy for children in child welfare cases, with a focus on more timely and comprehensive information gathering, and more consistent monitoring of the child's circumstances.

This bill establishes a comprehensive process for individuals born in Texas to obtain a new birth certificate that reflects a change in their name and/or sex, particularly for transgender individuals. The bill allows eligible persons to apply for a new birth certificate by submitting a signed statement from a physician confirming medical transition treatment, a completed application form, and paying an application fee (which can be waived for those unable to pay). The bill includes specific eligibility requirements, particularly for individuals with criminal histories, requiring notification of local law enforcement authorities in certain cases. Applicants with felony convictions may be eligible if they have been pardoned, completed supervision, or are seeking to align their name and sex with their criminal record. The new birth certificate will not reference the person's previous name or sex, and a separate certificate of change will be issued. The legislation ensures that the name or sex change does not affect the person's existing legal liabilities or rights, and provides a mechanism for updating government-issued identification. The bill explicitly preserves the option for individuals to seek a court-ordered name or sex change through traditional legal channels.

The amendment specifically allows institutions to submit statements about supporting first-generation college students, low-income students, and underserved student populations when applying for grants or seeking accreditation, without those statements being considered violations of the DEI office restrictions. The bill also clarifies that such statements can highlight the institution's work in supporting these student groups. The legislation will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or on January 1, 2026, if it does not receive the required immediate-effect vote.

This bill modifies Texas Family Code provisions regarding child name changes by expanding who can petition for a name change. Currently, parents, managing conservators, or guardians can file a petition to change a child's name in the county where the child resides. The bill now allows children who are at least 10 years old to file their own name change petition in their county of residence. Additionally, when a child files such a petition, the court is required to appoint an attorney ad litem (a lawyer specifically assigned to represent the child's interests) to represent the child during the name change hearing. The new provisions aim to provide older children with more agency in legal proceedings concerning their name while ensuring they have legal representation to protect their interests.

AN ACT relating to the period for which a public school student may be placed in a disciplinary alternative education program or expelled.	This bill modifies the Texas Education Code regarding student disciplinary procedures, specifically limiting the duration of disciplinary alternative education program (DAEP) placements and expulsions. The bill caps DAEP placements at 30 days and expulsions at 60 days, removing previous provisions that allowed longer placements based on district determinations of student threat levels. The legislation requires school districts to establish clear guidelines in their student codes of conduct for disciplinary actions, mandating consideration of factors such as self-defense, student intent, disciplinary history, and student disabilities when making disciplinary decisions. The bill also reduces the interval for reviewing a student's status in a DAEP or expulsion from 120 days to 10 days and maintains requirements for parental notification and opportunities to participate in disciplinary proceedings. Additionally, the bill ensures that for high school students in disciplinary programs, the school must review their academic progress and establish a specific graduation plan.

Under this provision, such individuals are prohibited from possessing a firearm for five years after their release from confinement or supervision. If a person violates this firearm possession restriction, they can be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which can be elevated to a third-degree felony under certain circumstances.

Schools must provide written notice to parents before the school year, detailing the content of sexuality education, and parents have the right to review curriculum materials and remove their children from instruction without penalty. The curriculum must also address critical issues like sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship abuse, and sex trafficking, and provide information about local sexual and reproductive health resources.

AN ACT relating to the repeal of statutes regarding the criminality or unacceptability of homosexual conduct and to the recognition of certain same-sex relationship statuses.	This bill repeals several existing statutes in Texas that criminalized or stigmatized homosexual conduct across multiple areas of state law, including the Family Code, Government Code, and Penal Code. Specifically, the bill removes language from health education curriculum requirements that previously characterized homosexuality as an unacceptable lifestyle or criminal offense. The bill eliminates provisions in sexual education materials that mandated emphasizing homosexual conduct as socially unacceptable, and instead focuses educational content on sexual abstinence, disease prevention, and responsible decision-making. By removing these discriminatory references, the bill effectively decriminalizes homosexual conduct and removes stigmatizing language from state statutes. The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or otherwise will become effective on September 1, 2025. This legislation represents a significant step towards legal equality and removing outdated, discriminatory language from Texas state law.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	61	6	José Menéndez (D)*, César Blanco (D)*, Molly Cook (D)*, Sarah Eckhardt (D)*, Roland Gutierrez (D)*, Nathan Johnson (D)*	Completely Reliable Method, Prevent Hiv Infection, Psychologically Sound Methods, Sex Relationship Statuses, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Education Programs Intended, Rebuff Unwanted Physical, Verbal Sexual Advances, Latest Medical Information, Making Decisions Relating	Government Affairs	70	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB190	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

This bill modifies the process for reviewing and registering delayed birth certificates in Texas, specifically adding two key provisions to the existing law. First, the bill prevents the state registrar (the official responsible for maintaining birth records) from rejecting an application for a delayed birth certificate based solely on inconsistent supporting evidence, if the overall application establishes the applicant's identity and place of birth. When evaluating such applications, the registrar must consider supporting evidence that raises questions about the birth location, the inclusion of a valid driver's license or personal ID, and verified affidavits from individuals with personal knowledge of the applicant's identity. Second, for persons born before January 1, 1971, the bill allows the state registrar to register a delayed birth certificate with only one parent's name if that parent's identity can be established through information that is not contradictory to existing records. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and appears designed to make the delayed birth certificate application process more flexible and accommodating for individuals who may have challenges documenting their birth details, particularly for older individuals.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	14	2	0	10	1	Royce West (D)*	Application Review Process, Delayed Birth Certificates, Give  Weight, Legitimate  Question, Safety Code, Valid Driver, Verified Affidavit, Supporting  Evidence, Supporting Evidence, Contradictory Information	Health and Social Services	37	Committee report printed and distributed	04/14/2025	04/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB227	False	11/12/2024	02/28/2025	Pro LGBT

The policy must be used concurrently with federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provisions and cannot require employees to use other paid leave first. Additionally, the bill expands prekindergarten eligibility to include children of classroom teachers, and creates a ""Healthy Families Allotment"" that reimburses school districts for the compensation of employees taking paid parental leave.

It requires employers to include information about reproductive decision discrimination in employee handbooks and prohibits employers from discriminating against employees, their spouses, partners, dependents, or family members based on reproductive choices. The bill also renders mandatory arbitration agreements void if they attempt to limit an employee's reproductive decisions, effectively protecting workers from contractual restrictions on their personal reproductive choices.

The exemption covers both the research itself and its subsequent dissemination.

The Texas Education Agency, in coordination with the Health and Human Services Commission, will be responsible for selecting the specific suicide prevention materials and information to be shared. These new requirements will take effect in the 2025-2026 school year, with the bill becoming law either immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the legislature or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the immediate voting threshold.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	7	1	0	27	4	José Menéndez (D)*, Carol Alvarado (D), Sarah Eckhardt (D), Chuy Hinojosa (D)	Requiring Public Schools, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Suicide Prevention Materials, School District, School Year, Alleged Victim, Education Code, Parents Notice, Providing Notice, Risks Related	Education	15	Referred to Education K-16	04/07/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2851	True	03/14/2025	03/15/2025	Pro LGBT

AN ACT relating to the establishment of a bullying prevention pilot program for public schools.	This bill establishes a bullying prevention pilot program for public schools in Texas, which requires the state education agency to develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce bullying incidents. The agency will create the program using research-based best practices and collaborate with experts in child psychology, mental health, and education. The program will provide grants to school districts that demonstrate a substantial need for bullying prevention, with each selected district implementing the pilot program on up to three campuses. The commissioner of education will set application criteria for grants, determine how grant money can be used, and may seek additional funding through grants or donations. The agency can provide technical assistance to grant recipients through regional education service centers. The pilot program is contingent on specific legislative appropriations, meaning it will only be implemented if dedicated funding is available. The bill defines bullying according to existing state law and is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, giving schools and the education agency time to prepare for the new initiative.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	6	1	0	18	3	José Menéndez (D)*, Sarah Eckhardt (D), Chuy Hinojosa (D)	Establish Application Criteria, Eligible School Districts, Public School Campuses, School Districts, Public Schools, School  District, School District, Meaning Assigned, Pilot Program, Reduce Incidents	Education	9	Referred to Education K-16	04/07/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2852	True	03/14/2025	03/15/2025	Pro LGBT

AN ACT relating to recognizing persons who separated from military service solely on the basis of sexual orientation as honorably discharged veterans under state law.	This bill aims to recognize military service members who were discharged from active military service solely due to their sexual orientation as honorably discharged veterans under Texas state law. The legislation provides a comprehensive framework for reclassifying veterans who previously received less favorable discharges because of their sexual orientation, specifically those with certain separation codes on their DD Form 214 (a standard military discharge document). The bill defines specific separation codes that, if present on a veteran's discharge record, would indicate a discharge based on sexual orientation, and allows these veterans to be considered honorably discharged retroactively. Consequently, veterans reclassified under this law would become eligible for all state benefits, rights, privileges, and immunities typically afforded to honorably discharged veterans. The bill will take effect on September 1, 2025, and represents a significant step towards addressing historical discrimination against LGBTQ+ service members who were often unfairly discharged from military service solely because of their sexual orientation. By providing a pathway for these veterans to be recognized with honor, the legislation seeks to remedy past injustices and ensure these individuals receive the respect and benefits they deserve.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	14	1	José Menéndez (D)*	Alphanumeric Code Found, Military Discharge Record, Military Service Solely, Separation Code Listed, Numeric Code Commonly, Honorably Discharged Veterans, Separation Code, Government Code, Honorably Discharged, Separation Codes	Military Affairs and Security	8	Referred to Vet Affairs	04/07/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2958	True	03/14/2025	03/15/2025	Pro LGBT

"This bill relates to parental rights in public education and reporting of misconduct and child abuse, with significant changes to educational policies and procedures. Here is a summary:

This bill establishes comprehensive new regulations for parental rights, school district grievance procedures, and reporting of employee misconduct in educational settings. It creates a detailed grievance policy requiring school districts to develop multi-level review processes for parent complaints, with specific timelines and procedural requirements. The bill enhances parental access to educational information by mandating districts provide clear information about parental rights, instructional materials, and course syllabi. Parents must now provide written consent for psychological examinations or tests of their children and are guaranteed the right to choose their child's educational setting. 

The bill also significantly expands misconduct reporting requirements for educational employees and service providers. It establishes a comprehensive system for reporting, investigating, and tracking potential misconduct, including creating a statewide registry of individuals who are not eligible for employment in educational settings. School districts and private schools must now report a broader range of potential misconduct, including inappropriate relationships, physical misconduct, and certain criminal activities. The bill includes provisions for immediate investigation, potential temporary suspension of certifications, and mandatory reporting to state agencies.

Additionally, the bill modifies child abuse reporting procedures, expands definitions of reportable misconduct, and creates new mechanisms for tracking and preventing potential harm to students.

This bill, known as the Ending Institutional Racism Act, aims to prohibit diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and certain considerations based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation in governmental entities. The bill establishes comprehensive restrictions on DEI offices and practices, prohibiting governmental entities from creating diversity offices, giving preferential treatment in hiring or contracting, requiring diversity statements, or mandating DEI training that references race, color, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Governmental entities, including state agencies, legislative bodies, judicial branches, counties, municipalities, and charter schools, must ensure their units do not engage in these practices. The bill allows employees or local residents to bring legal action against entities that violate these provisions, with potential remedies including declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. Additionally, the bill modifies multiple existing laws to remove references to minority, women-owned, or race-based business considerations in contracting and economic development programs, effectively standardizing government contracting to focus on color-blind and sex-neutral approaches. The changes will apply to contracts entered into on or after September 1, 2025, with the goal of eliminating what the bill's sponsors see as discriminatory practices in government operations.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	93	5	Carl Tepper (R)*, Janis Holt (R), Keresa Richardson (R), Angelia Orr (R), David Spiller (R)	High Wage Jobs, Online Searchable Database, Requiring Competitive Bids, Similar Insidious Circumstances, Student Organization Registered, Applicable Municipal Charters, Give Preferential Consideration, Promoting Differential Treatment, Providing Special Benefits, Vacated Defense Facilities	Government Affairs	1092	Referred to State Affairs	02/27/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB167	False	11/12/2024	11/13/2024	Anti LGBT

The new provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, with the SBOE required to develop the review form by January 1, 2026.

This bill introduces comprehensive restrictions on children's access to social media platforms in Texas, requiring social media companies to implement strict age verification processes and prohibit users under 18 from creating accounts. Specifically, the bill mandates that social media platforms must verify an individual's age using commercially reasonable methods based on transactional data before allowing account creation, and they must immediately delete any personal information used in the verification process. Social media companies are prohibited from knowingly allowing children to use their platforms and must delete a child's account within 10 days of a verified parental request. The bill defines a child as an individual younger than 18 and treats violations as deceptive trade practices subject to enforcement by the consumer protection division of the attorney general's office. Any personal information collected during age verification must be used solely for that purpose and cannot be retained, transmitted, or used for any other reason.

Religious organizations wanting to establish such a facility must develop a comprehensive care plan, create an employee training program, and contract with a mental health services provider. The facilities must be overseen by a diverse committee including religious leaders, mental health professionals, child welfare experts, and local elected officials. The bill introduces a unique ""faith-family program"" that allows religious organization members to mentor foster youth, potentially leading to foster or adoptive placements. While these facilities will be exempt from standard child-care licensing requirements, the Department of Health and Human Services will establish minimum standards to ensure child health and safety.

The bill requires governmental entities collecting vital statistics to identify individuals strictly as either male or female, with no alternative options. The legislative findings also assert that distinguishing between sexes can be legitimate in contexts such as athletics, correctional facilities, shelters, and other spaces where biology, safety, or privacy are relevant.

It requires that these spaces be designated and used exclusively by individuals matching their biological sex, which is determined by physical characteristics and original birth certificate.

The bill includes a penalty structure where entities violating these rules can be fined $5,000 for a first violation and $25,000 for subsequent violations. Citizens can file complaints with the Attorney General, who must investigate and provide notice before pursuing legal action. The bill also includes provisions making it financially risky for individuals or entities to challenge these privacy regulations in court, as they may be liable for the prevailing party's legal costs.

1750801	TX	HB370	Relating to eligibility of certain events under the Events Trust Fund.	AN ACT relating to eligibility of certain events under the Events Trust Fund	This bill amends the Texas Events Trust Fund law to add new eligibility restrictions for events receiving state funding, specifically focusing on sports competitions. The bill prohibits events from receiving funding if they allow biological males to compete in sports designated for female athletes. It defines a person's biological sex based on their original birth certificate or other government records, specifying that the sex designation must have been entered at or near birth or corrected for a clerical error. The bill clarifies that while biological males cannot compete in female-designated sports under this rule, they can still participate as coaches, support staff, or in other non-competing roles. This change is part of the existing Events Trust Fund framework, which provides state funding for certain competitive events that meet specific criteria, such as being selected through a competitive process and generating at least $1 million in incremental tax receipts. The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or otherwise on September 1, 2025.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	32	20	Valoree Swanson (R)*, Cecil Bell (R), Briscoe Cain (R), Pat Curry (R), Mark Dorazio (R), Stan Gerdes (R), Caroline Harris Davila (R), Richard Hayes (R), Andy Hopper (R), Helen Kerwin (R), Stan Kitzman (R), Terri Leo-Wilson (R), Mitch Little (R), Brent Money (R), Mike Olcott (R), Katrina Pierson (R), Joanne Shofner (R), Shelby Slawson (R), Steve Toth (R), Cody Vasut (R)	Prohibit Biological Males, Events Trust Fund, Official Birth Certificate, Site Selection Organization, Tax Receipts Determined, Biological Male, Biological Sex, Incremental Increase, Region Composed, Sole Site	Business and Industry	302	Referred to Culture, Recreation & Tourism	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB370	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT
1752138	TX	HB403	Relating to housing and placement of inmates and children according to biological sex.	AN ACT relating to housing and placement of inmates and children according to biological sex.	This bill, named the Female Prisoner Protection Act, establishes new requirements for housing and placing inmates and juveniles in Texas correctional and detention facilities based strictly on biological sex. The legislation mandates that both the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and Texas Juvenile Justice Department place individuals in facilities according to their biological sex, which is determined primarily by their original birth certificate or, if unavailable, by other government records. Specifically for inmates, biological sex will be initially assessed during intake screening using sex organs, with preference given to the original birth certificate if discrepancies arise. The bill cites legal precedents supporting the constitutional separation of inmates by sex and emphasizes protecting women from potential sexual abuse and ensuring equal access to rehabilitation opportunities. For juvenile facilities, placement will be based on the child's biological sex as stated on their original birth certificate, with provisions to ensure each individual's safety and health needs are considered. The Texas Juvenile Justice Board and the department's board are required to adopt rules implementing these provisions, ensuring compliance with state and federal law, including the Prison Rape Elimination Act standards. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the immediate effect vote.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	36	1	Valoree Swanson (R)*	Vital Statistics Unit, Intake Screening Required, Basic Facilities Afforded, Juvenile Board Created, Applicable Minimum Standards, Official Birth Certificate, Minimum Standards, Juvenile Board, Facility Required, Unquestionably Constitutional	Government Affairs	338	Referred to State Affairs	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB403	False	11/12/2024	11/13/2024	Anti LGBT

This bill prohibits Texas governmental entities (including state agencies, legislative bodies, courts, counties, municipalities, school districts, and charter schools) from compelling employees, job applicants, or contractors to provide diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements or participate in DEI training that references race, color, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation, unless required by federal law. The legislation specifically prevents these entities from giving preferential hiring consideration based on DEI statements and mandates that they develop policies to discipline employees who violate these restrictions. The bill allows exceptions for academic course instruction, scholarly research, student organization activities, guest speakers, programs enhancing academic achievement, and data collection. Employees or contractors who are required to participate in prohibited training may bring legal action for injunctive and declaratory relief, and the law applies to contracts with bid requests made public on or after its effective date.

AN ACT relating to the placement of children in a detention or correctional facility according to biological sex.	This bill, named the Juvenile Girls Protection Act, establishes new requirements for placing juveniles in detention or correctional facilities based on their biological sex. The legislation mandates that juvenile boards and the Texas Juvenile Justice Department must place children in facilities according to their biological sex, which is determined primarily by their official birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, another government record showing biological sex can be used. The birth certificate's sex designation must have been entered at or near the time of birth and only modified for clerical errors to be considered valid. The bill adds a new section to the Texas Family Code that allows these agencies to deny, suspend, or revoke facility registrations if they do not strictly comply with the new placement requirements. While emphasizing biological sex-based placement, the bill also requires consideration of each child's unique safety needs in accordance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act National Standards. The Texas Juvenile Justice Board must adopt rules to implement these provisions, ensuring compliance with state and federal law. The act will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the necessary immediate voting support.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	8	1	0	33	1	Valoree Swanson (R)*	Vital Statistics Unit, Juvenile Board Created, Applicable Minimum Standards, Official Birth Certificate, Juvenile Board, Minimum Standards, Biological Sex, Family Code, Juveniles Based, Strictly Comply	Justice	275	Left pending in subcommittee	03/20/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB437	False	11/12/2024	11/13/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the required inclusion of a person's sex on a birth certificate and prohibited change of sex on the birth certificate of certain minors.	This bill modifies Texas Health and Safety Code provisions regarding birth certificates, requiring that a child's biological sex be recorded as either male or female on birth certificates. The bill defines biological sex as determined by sex organs, chromosomes, or endogenous profile, and mandates that local registrars list this information on birth certificates. In cases where a child's biological sex is not clear at birth due to atypical or ambiguous sex organs or chromosomes, the birth certificate may be amended later when the sex is determined. The bill specifically restricts changes to a minor's biological sex on a birth certificate, allowing amendments only for correcting clerical errors, completing originally missing biological sex information, or addressing cases of initially ambiguous sex determination. These restrictions effectively prevent minors from changing their recorded biological sex on birth certificates except under very limited circumstances. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the required immediate voting threshold.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	31	1	Valoree Swanson (R)*	Amending Certificate Attached, Issues Birth Certificates, Biological Sex Information, Original Birth Certificate, Biological  Sex, Biological Sex, Birth  Certificate, Birth Certificate, Supplementary Certificate, Prohibited Change	Health and Social Services	277	Referred to Public Health	02/28/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB477	True	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to requiring parental consent for behavioral or mental health treatment by school district personnel.	This bill amends the Texas Education Code to require school district employees to obtain written parental consent before providing students with behavioral or mental health services or treatment. Specifically, the bill expands existing regulations to mandate parental permission for services including contraceptives, emergency contraceptives, and informational materials related to family planning, human sexuality, and mental health. The new requirement will apply starting with the 2025-2026 school year and is designed to give parents more control over their children's health-related interactions with school personnel. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or otherwise on September 1, 2025. The legislation builds upon existing provisions that already require parental consent for psychological examinations, tests, or treatments, with exceptions for special education requirements or tests mandated by state or federal law. By explicitly adding behavioral and mental health services to the consent requirements, the bill aims to increase parental involvement and oversight of school-based health services.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	8	1	0	34	1	Jared Patterson (R)*	Requiring Parental Consent, Mental Health Treatment, Mental Health, Written Consent, Education Code, Family Planning, Human Sexuality, Informational Materials, School District, Special Education	Education	249	Left pending in committee	04/08/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB497	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

This bill prohibits certain nonprofit state associations or organizations from providing training, instruction, insurance, or risk pool contracts to public primary or secondary schools, the Texas Education Agency, or regional education service centers. Specifically, the bill targets nonprofit entities that represent school boards and have adopted a particular mission principle (referencing Section 28.0022(a)(4)(A), which likely relates to a specific educational policy or concept). The restrictions apply only to new contracts entered into on or after the bill's effective date of September 1, 2025, meaning existing contracts will remain governed by the previous legal framework. This legislation appears to be aimed at limiting the services and influence of certain nonprofit educational associations by preventing them from offering training and insurance services to public educational institutions based on their organizational principles or mission statement.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	14	1	Richard Hayes (R)*	Public Educational Institutions, Public Educational Entities, Public Primary, Education Code, Organizing Principles, Risk Pool, Secondary School, Provide Directly, Providing Training, Entities	Education	225	Referred to Public Education	03/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB506	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

Specifically, political subdivisions are prohibited from spending public funds to hire registered lobbyists to lobby state legislators, or to pay nonprofit state associations that employ lobbyists. The bill allows exceptions for certain activities, such as county or municipal spending on lobbying related to military, military service members, or veterans. Nonprofit state associations representing political subdivisions can still have full-time employees provide legislative services like bill tracking, bill analysis, legislative alerts, and testifying before legislative committees. If a political subdivision violates these restrictions, a taxpayer or resident can seek a legal injunction to stop the activity and can recover their attorney's fees and costs. The bill also modifies existing law regarding county spending on membership fees and dues for nonprofit associations, ensuring such spending does not support political campaigns or candidate endorsements.

AN ACT relating to the establishment of an education savings account program, an insurance premium tax credit for contributions made for purposes of that program, and the award of attorney's fees in actions challenging certain educational choice laws.	This bill establishes a comprehensive education savings account (ESA) program that allows parents to use state funds to pay for various educational expenses for their children. The program provides eligible students with an annual payment equal to the state's average per-student spending, which can be used for tuition at private schools, online courses, educational therapies, textbooks, technology, testing fees, and other approved educational expenses. To participate, children must generally be eligible to attend public school and have either previously attended a public school or be entering kindergarten. The bill also creates an insurance premium tax credit to incentivize businesses to contribute to the ESA fund, with a cap of $200 million in credits for the first year and potential increases in subsequent years. Additionally, the bill includes provisions to deter legal challenges to the program by making those who seek to block the program potentially liable for the legal fees of the prevailing party. The program includes safeguards such as a parental review committee to approve educational service providers, random auditing, and rules preventing providers from overcharging participants. The ESA program is set to begin in the 2026-2027 school year, with the goal of empowering parents to choose the most appropriate educational options for their children.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	84	1	Matt Shaheen (R)*	Advanced Placement Test, Average Daily Attendance, Consenting Local Prosecutor, Adequate Legal Remedy, Educational Assistance Organizations, Prioritize Admitting Children, Standard Amount Charged, Criminal Justice Agency, Due Process Hearings, Free Exercise Clause	Education	219	Referred to Public Education	03/04/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB612	False	11/12/2024	01/28/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill adds a new section to the Texas Education Code that protects public school employees' rights to engage in religious speech or prayer while on duty. Specifically, the bill states that school districts, charter schools, and other state governmental entities cannot infringe upon an employee's ability to express religious speech or pray during work hours, unless two strict conditions are met: (1) the infringement is necessary to further a compelling state interest, and (2) the limitation is narrowly tailored using the least restrictive means to achieve that compelling state interest. This means that school administrators would face significant legal barriers if they attempt to restrict an employee's religious expression. The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or otherwise on September 1, 2025.

The requirements apply to a wide range of health insurance providers in Texas, including insurance companies, hospital service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and various government health programs like Medicaid and the child health plan program. The coverage must be provided even if the patient is no longer enrolled in the original health plan that performed the initial gender transition procedure, and must include annual mental and physical health monitoring.

The bill creates a 12-member Joint Legislative Committee on Constitutional Enforcement, composed of six representatives from the Texas House and six from the Senate, tasked with reviewing federal actions to determine their constitutionality. When reviewing federal actions, the committee must consider historical context, including ratifying debates, the understanding of the Constitution's framers, and early interpretations of constitutional powers. If the committee determines a federal action is unconstitutional by majority vote, the full legislature can vote to formally declare it invalid. Once declared unconstitutional, the federal action would have no legal effect in Texas, and state agencies and officials would be prohibited from spending public resources to implement or enforce it. The bill also grants Texas courts the ability to issue declaratory judgments about federal actions' constitutionality, requiring them to rely on the Constitution's original meaning rather than solely on previous court decisions. Additionally, the bill emphasizes the Tenth Amendment's principle that powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states, and it calls on all government officials to defend the Constitution and protect state sovereignty.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	13	2	0	14	8	Cecil Bell (R)*, David Spiller (R)*, Stan Gerdes (R)*, Terri Leo-Wilson (R)*, Will Metcalf (R)*, Richard Hayes (R), Janis Holt (R), Mitch Little (R)	Year Terms Beginning, Forward Official Copies, Incur Public Debt, Spend Public Money, Specific Powers Enumerated, Federal Agency Rule, Grant Declaratory Relief, Enumerated Powers Delegated, Written Opinion Determining, Federal Government Established	Government Affairs	346	Committee report sent to Calendars	04/10/2025	04/09/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB796	True	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

The law defines a ""drag performance"" as a performance where a performer presents a gender different from their birth-assigned gender through clothing, makeup, or physical markers, and performs in a manner deemed ""lascivious"" (sexually offensive to community standards). A minor can bring a lawsuit against anyone who knowingly promotes, conducts, or performs in a drag show that includes minors, if the performance violates community standards for age-appropriate content and the organizers fail to restrict minor access. If successful, the minor can receive actual damages (covering psychological, emotional, economic, and physical harm), reasonable attorney's fees, and $5,000 in statutory damages. The law provides limited defenses, such as if the defendant reasonably believed the minor was over 18 or if the minor presented apparently valid identification, but explicitly states that parental accompaniment is not a valid defense. The cause of action must be brought within 10 years of the performance, and the law will take effect on September 1, 2025, applying only to performances occurring on or after that date."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	34	5	Steve Toth (R)*, John McQueeney (R)*, Janis Holt (R), Andy Hopper (R), Will Metcalf (R)	Drag Performances Performed, Accrues, Change, Minor, Presence, Relating, Txhb	Government Affairs	319	Referred to State Affairs	03/06/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB938	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to affirmative defenses to prosecution for certain offenses involving material or conduct that is obscene or otherwise harmful to children.	"This bill modifies two sections of the Texas Penal Code related to affirmative defenses for offenses involving obscene material or conduct harmful to children. In Section 1, the bill changes the existing affirmative defense for selling, distributing, or exhibiting obscene material from having a ""scientific, educational, governmental, or other similar justification"" to specifically having a ""bona fide judicial, law enforcement, or legislative justification."" In Section 2, the bill alters the affirmative defenses for offenses related to children by removing ""educational, medical, psychological, psychiatric"" purposes and replacing them with ""judicial, law enforcement, or legislative purposes."" The bill also maintains two other existing affirmative defenses: if the defendant was married to the child at the time of the offense, or if the defendant is not more than two years older than the child. The changes will only apply to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2025, with previous offenses still governed by the law in effect at the time they were committed.

"This bill adds a new section to the Texas Education Code that prohibits courts, administrative agencies, or other tribunals from ordering or requiring school district employees to modify a student's permanent record to reflect a different sex than the student's biological sex. The bill specifically defines ""biological sex"" as the physical condition of being male or female, determined by sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous profile at birth. Essentially, this legislation prevents legal entities from compelling schools to change a student's official records regarding their sex or gender, regardless of any external legal proceedings or orders. The new law is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and appears to be designed to maintain what the bill's authors consider to be the objective, biological record of a student's sex in official school documentation, potentially limiting changes to gender identification on school records through judicial or administrative processes."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	33	1	Candy Noble (R)*	School District Employee, Public School Student, Student Permanent Record, Permanent Record, Administrative Agency, Education Code, Endogenous Profile, Physical Condition, Biological Sex, Sex Organs	Education	167	Referred to Public Education	03/06/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB973	False	11/12/2024	01/28/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to parental rights in public education and prohibiting certain instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity; authorizing a civil penalty.	This bill enhances parental rights in public education by introducing several key provisions. First, it requires school districts to establish procedures that notify parents about any changes in services or support related to their child's mental, emotional, or physical health, and mandates that school personnel encourage students to discuss their well-being with their parents. The bill prohibits school districts from adopting policies that prevent employees from informing parents about their child's health or that encourage students to withhold such information from parents. Additionally, the legislation restricts instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity for students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, defining such instruction as only permissible if it is age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate. The bill also allows parents to bring civil actions if they believe these parental rights have been violated, with potential damages and attorney's fees awarded. Schools can face civil penalties up to $10,000 for each violation, and the bill permits the attorney general to investigate and pursue these penalties. Furthermore, the legislation stipulates that school districts may not renew the employment contracts of employees who prevent parents from accessing records or who discourage parental notification about a student's health and well-being. These provisions will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, aiming to strengthen parental involvement and control in their children's education.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	90	2	Steve Toth (R)*, Janis Holt (R)	Accessing Written Records, Class Size Limits, Conduct Constituting Assault, Early Childhood Literacy, Mathematics Proficiency Plans, Military Readiness Plans, Criminal History Records, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Prohibit Parental Knowledge, Supportive Learning Environment	Education	244	Referred to Public Education	03/06/2025	11/13/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB976	False	11/12/2024	11/14/2024	Anti LGBT

The bill mandates that birth certificate forms must have a space to record the child's sex as either male or female, with male being defined as a child born with a Y chromosome and female being defined as a child born without a Y chromosome. Importantly, this biological sex classification method will apply to other laws in Texas related to determining a person's sex or gender. The Health and Human Services Commission is directed to develop and adopt the necessary rules to implement these changes, with the bill set to take effect on September 1, 2025.

The poster must be at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall, with a legible text that includes the full traditional version of the Ten Commandments. If schools do not already have such a display, they must accept privately donated posters that meet the specified requirements, and they may use public funds or private donations to replace existing displays. The bill mandates that schools use the exact biblical text, which includes commandments about worshipping God, respecting parents, and prohibitions against actions like killing, stealing, and lying. Schools with extra posters must offer them to other public schools for display. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, otherwise it will take effect on September 1, 2025. This legislation appears aimed at promoting religious display in public educational settings, which could potentially raise constitutional questions about separation of church and state.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	29	81	Mike Olcott (R)*, Daniel Alders (R), Jeffrey Barry (R), Cecil Bell (R), Keith Bell (R), Brad Buckley (R), Ben Bumgarner (R), Angie Button (R), Briscoe Cain (R), Giovanni Capriglione (R), David Cook (R), Tom Craddick (R), Charles Cunningham (R), Pat Curry (R), Jay Dean (R), Mano DeAyala (R), Mark Dorazio (R), Harold Dutton (D), Caroline Fairly (R), James Frank (R), Gary Gates (R), Stan Gerdes (R), Ryan Guillen (R), Sam Harless (R), Cody Harris (R), Caroline Harris Davila (R), Brian Harrison (R), Richard Hayes (R), Cole Hefner (R), Hillary Hickland (R), Janis Holt (R), Andy Hopper (R), Lacey Hull (R), Todd Hunter (R), Carrie Isaac (R), Helen Kerwin (R), Stan Kitzman (R), Marc LaHood (R), Jeff Leach (R), Terri Leo-Wilson (R), Mitch Little (R), Oscar Longoria (D), Janie Lopez (R), A.J.

AN ACT relating to regulations and policies for entering or using a bathroom or changing facility in a public school; authorizing a civil penalty, authorizing a private civil right of action.	This bill establishes new regulations for bathroom and changing facility usage in public schools in Texas, focusing on biological sex as the determining factor for accessing multiple-occupancy facilities. The bill defines multiple-occupancy facilities as spaces designed for more than one person at a time where individuals may be in a state of undress, such as restrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms. It requires school districts and charter schools to designate these facilities based strictly on a person's biological sex as stated on their original birth certificate, with limited exceptions for custodial, maintenance, medical, or assistance purposes. The legislation allows schools to provide single-occupancy accommodations upon request but prohibits allowing individuals to use multi-occupancy facilities designated for a biological sex different from their own. The bill introduces significant legal consequences, including a potential $100,000 civil penalty for violations and strict liability for personal injuries resulting from policies that permit cross-biological sex facility access. Notably, the bill also prevents school districts from considering a private entity's bathroom or changing facility policies when awarding contracts and provides a private right of civil action for privacy violations.

The legislation includes exceptions for specific scenarios like maintenance, medical emergencies, and assisting individuals, and stipulates that schools cannot consider a private entity's bathroom policy when awarding contracts.

The bill defines multi-occupancy facilities as spaces designed for more than one person to use simultaneously where individuals might be in a state of undress, such as restrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms. If a school district adopts a policy that allows students to use facilities based on criteria other than their biological sex assigned at birth, the district must: describe which facilities are not sex-segregated, explain supervision methods that ensure student safety and privacy, provide accommodations for students who prefer sex-separated facilities, post the policy on the district's website, and mail the policy to parents at the start of each school year. The bill explicitly excludes faculty bathrooms from these requirements and will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, with the potential for immediate implementation if it receives a two-thirds vote from the Texas Legislature.

The bill authorizes licensing authorities to impose administrative penalties against healthcare providers who violate these new regulations, using the same procedures and methods they would use to penalize violations of other licensing or regulatory rules. In vitro fertilization is a medical procedure where eggs are fertilized by sperm outside the body in a laboratory setting, and the resulting embryos are then potentially implanted in a woman's uterus.

Under the new law, if a minor receives such medical treatments, they would have until their 25th birthday to file a health care liability claim related to those specific treatments, regardless of the standard two-year or 10-year limitations.

The legislation mandates that physicians conducting physical examinations must not approve participation if they suspect chromosomal inconsistencies with the student's assigned birth sex, and requires referral for genetic testing in such cases. The University Interscholastic League (UIL) is tasked with adopting rules to implement these requirements, ensuring proper examination procedures while maintaining student medical information confidentiality. The bill includes a provision protecting healthcare professionals, the UIL, and school districts from liability related to these athletic participation guidelines.

AN ACT relating to the use by a political subdivision of public funds for lobbying and certain other activities.	This bill restricts how political subdivisions (like counties) can use public funds for lobbying activities. Specifically, it prohibits political subdivisions from spending public money to hire registered lobbyists to lobby state legislators or to pay membership fees to nonprofit associations that hire lobbyists. The bill allows taxpayers or residents to seek legal injunctions to stop such spending and to recover their legal fees if they successfully challenge these expenditures. It also modifies existing laws about county commissioners' participation in county associations, clarifying that they cannot spend public funds to join or serve on associations in violation of the new lobbying restrictions. Additionally, the bill removes previous language that allowed associations to provide legislative information and adds provisions that prevent associations from contributing to political campaigns or endorsing candidates. The new restrictions will apply to expenditures made on or after September 1, 2025, and any existing contract terms that violate these provisions will be considered void on that date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	22	1	Ellen Troxclair (R)*	Joint Endeavor Created, Local Government Code, Organization Supported Wholly, Public Funds Related, Spend Public Funds, Entity Created Pursuant, Public Funds, Government Code, Operating Pursuant, Public Office	Government Affairs	173	Referred to State Affairs	03/07/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1189	True	11/12/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the establishment of the State Agency Rules Review Commission and the procedures by which state agencies adopt rules.	This bill establishes the State Agency Rules Review Commission (SARRC), a new legislative branch agency designed to provide oversight of state agency rulemaking. The commission will consist of 11 members: four senators, four representatives, and three public members appointed by the lieutenant governor, speaker of the house, and governor respectively. The commission will review all final rules adopted by state agencies to ensure they are legally authorized, clear, unambiguous, and reasonably necessary. When a state agency submits a rule, the commission has 30 days to determine whether the rule meets these criteria. If the rule does not satisfy the requirements, the commission can return the rule to the agency with a written explanation, requiring the agency to either revise the rule or withdraw it. The bill also allows individuals who are denied a petition to create a rule to appeal to the commission. Additionally, the bill requires the commission to broadcast its meetings online and post meeting materials publicly, enhancing transparency. The commission will be subject to a limited review every 12 years, with the first review to be completed by December 31, 2030. The new oversight mechanism aims to improve the rulemaking process by providing an additional layer of legislative review and ensuring that state agency rules are well-crafted, legally sound, and necessary.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	20	1	Carl Tepper (R)*	Online Archive Located, Youth Camp Operators, Order Finally Adopts, Final Order Requiring, Determination Based Solely, Regularly Scheduled Meeting, Final Order Adopted, Emergency Rule Adopted, Revised Rule Addresses, Final Rule Adopted	Government Affairs	102	Referred to Delivery of Government Efficiency	03/10/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1259	False	11/12/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT
1752289	TX	HB1267	Relating to the recall of a United States senator by the legislature.	AN ACT relating to the recall of a United States senator by the legislature.	This bill proposes to allow the Texas Legislature to recall a United States Senator representing Texas through a majority vote in both legislative chambers, effectively creating a state-level mechanism to remove a federally elected senator. The bill's preamble argues that the 17th Amendment (which established direct popular election of senators) has diminished states' rights and that the federal government has overreached its constitutional authorities. Specifically, the proposed legislation would add a new Chapter 147 to the Texas Election Code, enabling the state legislature to remove a U.S. Senator, with the recall taking effect immediately upon a successful vote, which would create a vacancy in the senate seat. The bill would take effect either immediately if it receives a two-thirds majority vote in both legislative chambers, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not obtain the required supermajority. The underlying motivation appears to be restoring what the bill's sponsors view as the original constitutional design of senators serving state interests, though such a provision would likely face significant legal challenges regarding federal election laws and constitutional procedures.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	13	1	Brian Harrison (R)*	Human Endeavor Including, Original Constitutional Design, Federal Senators Serve, Federal Government, Election Code, Significantly Diminished, Unconstitutional Encroachments, Amendment Rights, Majority Vote, Successful Recall	Government Affairs	200	Referred to State Affairs	03/10/2025	11/13/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1267	False	11/13/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

"This bill aims to prohibit teaching certain concepts related to personal identity characteristics in Texas public elementary and secondary schools.

Schools would be prohibited from instructing students that an individual's moral character is determined by their personal characteristics, or that they should feel guilt or psychological distress because of their identity. The bill establishes legal mechanisms for enforcement, allowing individuals and the attorney general to file lawsuits to stop violations, with potential court-assessed litigation costs. Furthermore, starting January 1, 2026, educators who knowingly engage in prohibited instructional practices could face criminal misdemeanor charges, with potential penalties including fines between $100-$500, up to six months in county jail, or both.

Governmental employers are forbidden from engaging in these practices, establishing offices or positions to promote such practices, or requiring employees to participate in prohibited trainings or submit documents related to these topics. The bill provides legal remedies, allowing individuals and the attorney general to bring mandamus or injunction actions against violators, with potential penalties including fines up to $5,000 and up to six months in county jail for individuals who knowingly facilitate discriminatory practices. The legislation explicitly preserves exceptions for actions required by law, athletic competitions, personal privacy accommodations, and dress codes.

The policy prohibits using public address systems for prayers, ensures that the religious activity does not interfere with instructional time, and mandates that students or employees who have not submitted consent forms are not exposed to the prayers or readings. Participants can revoke their consent at any time, and the bill maintains that students and employees can still engage in individual, voluntary prayer during non-designated times. The attorney general is required to provide guidance to schools implementing this policy and can defend schools in potential legal challenges. Each school district and charter school must vote on whether to adopt such a policy within six months, and the bill will apply starting in the 2025-2026 school year.

The changes will only apply to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2025, with previous offenses still governed by the law in effect at the time of the offense.

AN ACT relating to repealing the affirmative defense to prosecution for the criminal offense of sale, distribution, or display of harmful material to a minor.	This bill repeals Section 43.24(c) of the Texas Penal Code, which currently provides an affirmative defense to prosecution for the criminal offense of selling, distributing, or displaying harmful material to a minor. An affirmative defense is a legal strategy where the defendant admits to the act but argues they should not be held legally responsible due to specific circumstances. By removing this provision, the bill eliminates a legal protection that previously allowed defendants to potentially avoid conviction under certain conditions. The bill specifies that these changes will only apply to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2025, meaning that for any offenses committed before this date, the previous law will still govern. This ensures that individuals cannot be retroactively prosecuted under the new legal standard. The bill is scheduled to take effect on September 1, 2025, giving time for legal professionals and the public to prepare for the change in the law.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	9	3	Terri Leo-Wilson (R)*, Andy Hopper (R), Valoree Swanson (R)	Affirmative Defense, Harmful Material, Penal Code, Criminal Offense, Offense Occurred, Offense Committed, Offense, Committed, Relating, Txhb	Government Affairs	129	Referred to State Affairs	03/14/2025	01/08/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1774	False	01/08/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the instructional materials for certain curriculum in public schools, including certain instructional prohibitions and requirements regarding those materials.	This bill modifies Texas education law to place several restrictions on curriculum and instructional materials in public schools. It requires school districts to adopt instructional materials for civics education and places significant limitations on how teachers can discuss controversial topics. Specifically, teachers cannot be compelled to discuss controversial public policy or social issues, and if they do, must explore them objectively and without political bias. The bill prohibits schools from requiring students to engage in political lobbying, activism, or policy advocacy activities. Moreover, it bars educators from teaching or incorporating instructional materials that suggest: any race or sex is inherently superior, individuals are inherently racist or oppressive based on their race or sex, or that meritocracy and work ethic are racist constructs. The bill explicitly forbids teaching the 1619 Project and requires that slavery and racism be presented as deviations from, rather than fundamental to, American founding principles. These provisions will take effect in the 2025-2026 school year, with the potential for immediate implementation if the bill receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	42	1	Terri Leo-Wilson (R)*	Duties Involve Directly, Authentic Founding Principles, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Social Policy Advocacy, Hard Work Ethic, Public Policy Advocacy, Social Studies Curriculum, Adopts Instructional Materials, Including Extra Credit, Public Policy	Education	97	Referred to Public Education	03/14/2025	01/16/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1927	False	01/16/2025	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

"This bill creates a new criminal offense called misrepresenting medical history to obtain unnecessary medical treatment for vulnerable individuals, named ""Alyssa's Law"". The law specifically targets situations where a person knowingly provides false medical information about a child, elderly, or disabled individual to a healthcare institution or provider with the intent of obtaining unnecessary medical treatment. If the misrepresentation results in the victim suffering bodily injury or mental deficiency/impairment, the offender can be charged with a third-degree felony. The bill defines key terms such as ""medical history"" (excluding vaccination history) and specifies that ""child"" means a person under 18, while ""disabled"" and ""elderly"" individuals are defined according to existing legal definitions.

In section 43.26(c), the bill also refines the language to explicitly state an affirmative defense for conduct with a bona fide judicial or law enforcement purpose. The changes will apply only to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2025, with previous offenses still governed by the law in effect at the time they were committed.

The bill requires political subdivisions and state agencies to designate private spaces (including restrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, and sleeping quarters) for exclusive use by individuals matching their biological sex. The legislation allows some exceptions, such as for custodial purposes, emergency assistance, or accompanying children, and permits accommodations for people with disabilities or special circumstances. Political subdivisions or state agencies that violate these regulations can be subject to civil penalties of $5,000 for a first violation and $25,000 for subsequent violations. Citizens can file complaints with the Attorney General, who must investigate and may pursue legal action. The bill also includes a provision that anyone seeking to challenge these privacy laws in court may be liable for the prevailing party's legal costs and fees.

The legislation includes broad provisions that limit potential defenses to such lawsuits, such as ignorance of the law, reliance on past court decisions, or claims of constitutional rights. The bill explicitly states that it can only be enforced through private civil actions and prohibits state officials from directly enforcing or intervening in such lawsuits.

This bill modifies regulations around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at Texas public higher education institutions by removing previous language that allowed institutions to highlight support for certain student populations and instead imposing new reporting and compliance requirements. Specifically, the bill requires each institution's governing board to submit an annual report to the legislature and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board certifying compliance with restrictions on DEI activities, mandates testimony before legislative committees about such compliance, and establishes a state auditor compliance audit process occurring at least every four years. If an institution is found to have spent state money in violation of the restrictions, it must cure the violation within 180 days or risk losing funding increases and enhancements in the subsequent fiscal biennium. The bill also allows students or employees to seek legal relief if they are required to participate in training they believe violates the law. Additionally, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board must conduct a biennial study examining the impact of these restrictions on student demographics and academic outcomes, with reports submitted to the legislature until September 1, 2029.

This bill adds a new section to the Texas Government Code that requires state agencies to readopt, readopt with amendments, or repeal existing rules under specific circumstances involving documents incorporated by reference. Specifically, if a rule implements a state law or policy that references an external document (such as a technical standard or industry guideline), and an amendment to that external document would either expand the agency's regulatory authority on a matter of state policy or impose a greater economic burden on regulated entities or the state's economy, the agency must take action to address the rule.

The bill requires annual state audits to ensure compliance and imposes significant penalties for violations, including potential loss of state funding. If an institution is found to have violated these provisions, employees who teach such courses could be placed on unpaid leave for a first offense or fired for subsequent offenses, with their names added to a coordinating board list that would prevent them from being rehired at other state institutions for up to five years.

The legislation would take effect for the 2026-2027 academic year, with immediate implementation possible if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature.

The bill introduces significant changes to charter school admission policies, including allowing a weighted lottery system that can give preference to students with special needs, emergent bilingual students, or those who are educationally disadvantaged. Additionally, the legislation modifies employment requirements, allowing teachers of noncore career and technical education courses to be hired without a baccalaureate degree if they meet specific qualifications. Charter schools will now be required to publicly disclose their admission and enrollment policies, including details about their lottery selection process. The bill also clarifies that assistant principals and assistant directors are not considered officers or members of a charter school's governing body.

AN ACT relating to a prohibition on public institutions of higher education requiring students to enroll in certain courses to complete a certificate or degree program, using such courses to satisfy general education requirements, funding such courses using state appropriations, or requiring related faculty practices, and to freshman student orientation at those institutions.	This bill restricts public higher education institutions in Texas from requiring students to take courses that discuss certain topics related to race, gender, and social theory, effectively limiting discussions about systemic racism, privilege, identity, and social justice. Specifically, the bill prohibits institutions from mandating courses that explore concepts like critical theory, intersectionality, unconscious bias, or race and gender-based equity in their general education curriculum or degree programs. The legislation prevents faculty from being compelled to include such content in their courses or being evaluated based on their inclusion of these topics, though it allows for specific ethnic or gender studies programs with strict limitations. The bill permits discussion of historical instances of discrimination like slavery or the Holocaust, and does not prevent compliance with anti-discrimination laws. Institutions are barred from using state appropriations to fund courses covering the prohibited topics, and they must report their compliance to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board starting in the 2026 fiscal year.

AN ACT relating to general definitions regarding biological sex and the designation and use of certain spaces according to biological sex; authorizing a civil right of action.	"This bill seeks to establish clear legal definitions for biological sex and regulate the use of multi-occupancy spaces in certain public facilities, with a focus on protecting women and girls. The bill defines key terms like ""male,"" ""female,"" ""boy,"" and ""girl"" based strictly on reproductive biological characteristics, specifying that sex is determined at birth. It requires covered facilities such as correctional facilities, schools, homeless shelters, and family violence centers to designate multi-occupancy spaces like restrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping quarters exclusively for either males or females, and prohibits individuals from using spaces not matching their biological sex. The legislation provides a private right of action for individuals who believe a facility has violated these provisions, allowing them to seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages. The bill's findings emphasize historical and legal precedents recognizing biological differences between sexes, and it argues that such distinctions are constitutionally permissible when substantially related to important government interests like privacy and safety.

AN ACT relating to affirmative defenses to prosecution for certain criminal offenses involving material or conduct that may be obscene or is otherwise harmful to children.	"This bill modifies the Texas Penal Code's provisions regarding affirmative defenses for certain criminal offenses involving potentially obscene material or conduct harmful to children. Specifically, the bill removes the existing affirmative defense that allows conduct for ""bona fide educational, medical, psychological, psychiatric, judicial, law enforcement, or legislative purposes"" from Section 43.25, which appears to relate to sexual offenses involving minors. The bill narrows the existing affirmative defenses, maintaining only two: (1) the defendant was married to the child at the time of the offense, or (2) the defendant is not more than two years older than the child. For Section 43.26, which likely concerns possession or promotion of obscene material, the bill adds a limited affirmative defense specifically for judicial, law enforcement, or legislative purposes. The bill will take effect on September 1, 2025, and will only apply to offenses committed on or after that date, meaning prior offenses will be governed by the law in effect at the time they were committed. This change appears to restrict the circumstances under which individuals can claim an affirmative defense in cases involving potentially obscene material or conduct related to minors."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	18	1	Mitch Little (R)*	Bona Fide Educational, Affirmative Defenses Provided, Affirmative Defenses, Affirmative Defense, Penal Code, Years Older, Offense Occurred, Legislative Purpose, Offense Committed, Offense	Government Affairs	241	Referred to State Affairs	03/18/2025	02/12/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB2710	False	02/12/2025	02/28/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill establishes strict restrictions on municipal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Texas, defining DEI as programs that focus on identity classifications like race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity. The bill prohibits municipalities from spending public money on DEI-related activities, including funding departments, hiring contractors, promoting events, requiring employee training, or providing scholarships that consider identity classifications. Municipalities are required to avoid considering identity classifications in decision-making processes and must instead focus on individual merit when making hiring, promotion, and resource allocation choices. If a municipality is found to violate these provisions, it can face significant penalties, including being barred from adopting tax rates above the no-new-revenue tax rate for three years and being ineligible for state grant funds for two years. The attorney general is empowered to bring enforcement actions in Travis County or the county where the violation occurs. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and aims to prevent what it considers discriminatory practices in local government employment and programming by restricting the use of identity-based considerations in municipal operations.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	31	1	Nate Schatzline (R)*	Organizational Decision Making, Rectify Past Wrongs, Local Government Code, New-Revenue Tax Rate, Spend Public Money, Identity Classification Group, Identity Classification Groups, Promotes Discriminatory Treatment, Inclusion Initiatives Sec, Public  Money	Government Affairs	75	Referred to State Affairs	03/19/2025	02/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB2770	False	02/13/2025	02/18/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to protection of the rights of conscience of persons from providing and health care facilities from offering certain health care services; providing a civil remedy; authorizing disciplinary action.	"This bill introduces the Texas Health Care Conscience Protection Act, which establishes comprehensive protections for healthcare providers and facilities to decline participation in certain healthcare services based on their sincerely held religious or philosophical moral convictions. The legislation defines ""conscience"" as a deeply held set of moral beliefs and broadly defines healthcare providers, facilities, and services to include a wide range of medical professionals and treatments. Under the bill, physicians, healthcare providers, and facilities may refuse to participate in or offer specific healthcare services that conflict with their conscience, with notable exceptions for emergency medical treatment and life-sustaining treatment. The bill provides legal immunity for those exercising their rights of conscience, prohibits adverse actions against providers who decline services, and requires healthcare facilities to develop protocols for patient referrals when services are declined. Individuals or facilities that experience violations can file complaints with licensing agencies and potentially pursue civil action, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees. The bill aims to protect healthcare professionals from discrimination in licensing, employment, educational programs, and other professional contexts while ensuring patients can still access necessary medical care through alternative providers or facilities.

This bill introduces strict limitations on county-level diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Texas, prohibiting counties from spending public money on activities related to DEI programs. Specifically, the bill defines DEI initiatives as efforts that centralize identity classifications (based on race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity) and seeks to prevent counties from funding DEI-related departments, programs, events, training, scholarships, media, or organizational efforts. Counties would be required to avoid considering identity classifications in decision-making processes like hiring and promotions, instead focusing solely on individual merit. The bill empowers the attorney general to enforce these provisions through legal action, with potential penalties including a three-year restriction on adopting tax rates above the no-new-revenue tax rate and a two-year ban on receiving state grant funds for counties found in violation. The legislation is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and represents a significant effort to limit what the bill's sponsors likely view as discriminatory or divisive workplace practices centered on identity group representation.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	32	1	Nate Schatzline (R)*	Organizational Decision Making, Rectify Past Wrongs, Local Government Code, New-Revenue Tax Rate, Spend Public Money, Identity Classification Group, Identity Classification Groups, Promotes Discriminatory Treatment, Inclusion Initiatives Sec, Public  Money	Government Affairs	51	Referred to State Affairs	03/19/2025	02/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB2821	False	02/13/2025	02/26/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill enhances parental rights in Texas public education by establishing several key provisions. The legislation requires school districts to create a grievance procedure that allows parents to submit complaints and receive a resolution or written explanation within 30 days, with the option to pursue civil action if unresolved. It mandates that school districts notify parents about any changes in services related to a student's mental, emotional, or physical health, and prohibits school personnel from discouraging parental involvement or withholding information about a student's well-being. The bill also introduces restrictions on instruction and student activities, specifically prohibiting school districts from providing instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity and requiring parental written consent for students to participate in clubs that promote themes of sexuality, gender, or gender identity. Additionally, the bill requires schools to provide parents with information about a student's perception of their biological sex and mandates that schools offer written notice of health-related services before the start of each school year. These provisions aim to increase parental transparency and involvement in their children's education, with the changes set to take effect in the 2025-2026 school year.

The legislation prohibits courses from distorting historical events, teaching identity politics, or presenting theories that suggest systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in U.S. or Texas institutions. Additionally, the bill mandates specific learning outcomes for various course types, including communication, mathematics, science, language, literature, philosophy, arts, U.S. history, U.S. government, and behavioral and social sciences. For example, a U.S. history course must provide a broad understanding of U.S. and Texas history, while a U.S. government course must cover foundational principles like natural rights, liberty, equality, democracy, separation of powers, checks and balances, and governmental structures. The bill aims to standardize and potentially reshape the content and approach of core curriculum courses across Texas higher education institutions, with an emphasis on what the legislators view as foundational and objective educational principles.

The bill creates a new State Funding Integrity Review Division within the Legislative Budget Board that will be responsible for reviewing state-funded grants and contracts to identify and prevent funding to organizations deemed to be promoting these restricted ideological programs. If an organization is found to be in violation, the comptroller may be prohibited from issuing warrants to that organization for up to five years, and the division can recommend budgetary restrictions for state agencies that improperly allocate funds. The bill also introduces a civil penalty mechanism where entities that knowingly misrepresent their activities to receive state money can be liable for a penalty up to the amount of state money they received, with the attorney general authorized to pursue such penalties.

AN ACT relating to the prohibition of access by minors to sexually explicit materials in municipal public library collections; providing a civil penalty.	This bill establishes new regulations for municipal public libraries in Texas regarding sexually explicit materials, defining such materials as communications that describe sexual conduct according to the Penal Code. The legislation requires libraries to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit materials by implementing age verification measures and prohibiting such materials in areas designated for children and teens. Libraries must conduct annual reviews of their collections to identify and remove any sexually explicit materials from minor-accessible sections, with a process for public petitions to challenge specific materials. If a library is found to have violated these restrictions, it may face significant penalties, including potential loss of state and local funding and a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. The Texas State Library and Archives Commission will oversee enforcement and develop guidelines for collection reviews, with libraries required to have their first comprehensive review by January 1, 2027. The bill allows the attorney general to take legal action to enforce compliance and recover associated expenses, and it explicitly exempts religious materials from these restrictions. The new regulations will take effect on September 1, 2025, giving libraries time to prepare and adjust their collections and policies.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	9	1	0	34	52	Daniel Alders (R)*, Cole Hefner (R)*, Will Metcalf (R)*, Trent Ashby (R), Cecil Bell (R), Brad Buckley (R), Ben Bumgarner (R), Briscoe Cain (R), Charles Cunningham (R), Jay Dean (R), Mark Dorazio (R), Caroline Fairly (R), James Frank (R), Stan Gerdes (R), Ryan Guillen (R), Caroline Harris Davila (R), Richard Hayes (R), Hillary Hickland (R), Janis Holt (R), Andy Hopper (R), Carrie Isaac (R), Helen Kerwin (R), Stan Kitzman (R), Marc LaHood (R), Stan Lambert (R), Terri Leo-Wilson (R), Mitch Little (R), A.J.

Specifically, political subdivisions are prohibited from spending public money to hire registered lobbyists to lobby state legislators or to pay nonprofit associations that hire such lobbyists. However, the bill does allow some exceptions, such as allowing elected or public officials to provide information to legislators, appear before legislative committees, or advocate for or against legislation without triggering lobbyist registration requirements. If a political subdivision violates these restrictions, taxpayers or residents can seek a legal injunction to stop the activity and can recover their attorney's fees if successful. The bill also modifies existing law regarding county associations, further limiting their ability to influence legislation or support political campaigns.

This bill repeals Section 43.24(c) of the Texas Penal Code, which previously provided an affirmative defense to prosecution for the criminal offense of selling, distributing, or displaying harmful material to a minor. An affirmative defense is a legal strategy that, even if the facts of the alleged crime are true, provides a defendant with a legal justification or excuse that could potentially prevent conviction. By eliminating this section, the bill removes a previous legal protection that might have allowed defendants to avoid prosecution in such cases. The bill will apply only to offenses committed on or after September 1, 2025, meaning that for any offenses that occurred before that date, the previous law will still govern.

This bill expands existing Texas legislation to prohibit gender-affirming medical procedures and treatments for individuals of all ages, not just children. The bill bans physicians and healthcare providers from performing surgeries that could sterilize a person, such as castration, hysterectomy, and various gender transition-related procedures. It also prohibits prescribing puberty blockers, hormone treatments that could induce infertility, and removing healthy body parts. The legislation includes limited exceptions for individuals with specific genetic disorders of sex development or those who began a course of treatment before June 1, 2025, and underwent at least 12 mental health counseling sessions. The bill further restricts the use of public money for such procedures, prevents Medicaid and child health plan reimbursements for prohibited treatments, and ensures that state health plans cannot provide coverage for medical services intended to transition a person's biological sex. This legislation effectively makes it illegal for healthcare providers to offer comprehensive gender-affirming care in Texas, applying restrictions that were previously limited to minors to now include individuals of all ages.

Specifically, the bill prohibits teachers from: using gender pronouns other than those matching a student's biological sex; supporting or encouraging students to dress as the opposite sex; helping students change their names; discussing or promoting transgender lifestyles; providing connections to LGBTQ+ organizations; discussing transgender treatments or therapies; and introducing concepts of gender fluidity or the existence of more than two genders. The legislation carries significant potential consequences for teachers who violate these provisions, including potential termination of employment, suspension or revocation of teaching certification, and potential legal liability, with parents granted the right to sue teachers who breach these restrictions. A parent who successfully sues could be awarded compensatory or punitive damages, and the teacher would lose their standard immunity from liability. The bill is set to take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, with the potential for immediate implementation if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature.

The bill mandates that school districts develop a communication policy governing how school employees discuss topics related to reproductive and sexual health, requiring them to redirect student inquiries to parents, counselors, or specific teachers. School districts must also adopt written policies specifying when, if ever, they may host extracurricular activities related to human sexuality. The legislation empowers attorneys general or county attorneys to take legal action against school districts they believe are violating these provisions. Additionally, the bill preserves students' First Amendment rights to free speech and allows authorized personnel to provide mental or physical health services with parental consent. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the required immediate approval vote.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	106	1	Caroline Harris Davila (R)*	Class Size Limits, Conduct Constituting Assault, Duties Include Recommending, Early Childhood Literacy, Expressive Conduct Protected, Mathematics Proficiency Plans, Military Readiness Plans, Social Media Application, Behavioral Health Concerns, Mental Health Concerns	Education	35	Referred to Public Education	03/24/2025	02/28/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB3548	True	02/28/2025	03/04/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to certain prohibited considerations in contracting by governmental entities and the elimination of the state's historically underutilized business program.	This bill prohibits governmental entities in Texas from awarding contracts or providing preferential treatment based on an individual's race, color, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The bill effectively eliminates the state's Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) program by repealing Chapter 2161 of the Government Code, which previously governed minority and women-owned business participation in state contracts. The new provision (Section 2252.911) broadly prevents any discrimination or preference in contract awards based on personal characteristics. The bill will apply only to contracts entered into on or after September 1, 2025, meaning existing contracts will not be immediately impacted. Additionally, the bill includes a provision ensuring that any fund transfers previously directed by the Legislative Budget Board under the old HUB program rules will remain valid. This legislation represents a significant change in how Texas governmental entities approach diversity and inclusion in contracting, effectively removing race and gender-based considerations from the procurement process.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	23	1	Don McLaughlin (R)*	Legislative Budget Board, Provide Preferential Treatment, Funds Directed, Gender Identity, Government Code, Governmental Entities, Governmental Entity, Meaning  Assigned, Prohibited Considerations, Sexual Orientation	Government Affairs	39	Referred to State Affairs	03/25/2025	03/03/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB3573	False	03/03/2025	03/03/2025	Anti LGBT

For public schools, if a violation is found, the school could have its state funding withheld. For health care facilities, employees who violate the prohibition could face civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation and potential loss of professional licenses. The bill applies to both traditional public schools and open-enrollment charter schools, and extends to all governmental entities. Employees would receive a formal warning for a first violation and could be terminated for subsequent violations.

The bill mandates that school districts develop collection development policies that prohibit harmful, sexually explicit, or pervasively vulgar materials while preventing material removal based solely on ideas or author background. A key provision establishes a formal challenge procedure allowing parents or district residents to contest library materials, which involves creating a reconsideration committee comprising district staff and parents to review challenged materials.

Schools are prohibited from removing materials solely based on the ideas contained in them or the personal background of authors or characters. The bill introduces a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation, which can be investigated and pursued by the attorney general in Travis County or the county where the school district's principal office is located. The bill also waives sovereign immunity for these liability claims and requires the Texas State Library and Archives Commission to adopt new standards by the 2025-2026 school year, with the Act taking full effect at that time.

This bill establishes comprehensive regulations for mobile device app stores in Texas, focusing on protecting minors' online experiences. The legislation requires app stores to verify users' ages using commercially reasonable methods and assign users to specific age categories ranging from children (under 13) to legal adults (21 and older). App stores must obtain parental consent for minors before they can download or purchase software applications or make in-app purchases, and must clearly display age ratings and content information for each application. Software application developers must assign age ratings to their applications, provide detailed content information, and create systems to verify user ages and parental consent. The bill mandates that developers offer features for parents to monitor and limit their children's app usage. App stores and developers must also provide easy-to-access parental controls and protect user personal data. Enforcement mechanisms include civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations (or $20,000 for knowing or repeated violations), with the attorney general empowered to bring actions for penalties, injunctions, and cost recovery.

This bill amends Section 22.04 of the Texas Penal Code to clarify that individuals cannot be criminally liable for refusing to affirm, accept, or express approval of another person's homosexual or transgender inclinations or behaviors, or their efforts to obtain an abortion. Specifically, the bill adds two nearly identical subsections (n and i) to the existing law that explicitly protect parents and other individuals from potential criminal investigations or prosecution if they criticize, oppose, attempt to change, or simply refuse to endorse these personal choices or identities. The bill includes a severability clause, which means that if any part of the law is found to be invalid, the rest of the law can still remain in effect, and it is set to take effect on September 1, 2025.

This bill prohibits public institutions of higher education in Texas from providing funding to student organizations that engage in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which the bill defines as initiatives that provide differential treatment or special benefits based on race, color, or ethnicity. Specifically, the bill bars funding for any student organization that adopts a DEI policy, holds DEI-related programs or events, maintains an office or officer dedicated to DEI, or promotes DEI initiatives. The bill defines student organizations as groups composed mostly of enrolled students and gives the attorney general the authority to take legal action against institutions that violate this prohibition. Additionally, the bill allows individuals who believe an institution has violated this restriction to file a complaint with the attorney general. The legislation would take effect for the 2025-2026 academic year, with the potential for immediate implementation if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature.

Schools must annually post this document on their websites, email it to parents, include it in enrollment materials, and provide it in the parent's native language. Additionally, schools must notify parents about all health-related services offered and provide at least 20 days' notice before any health screenings. The bill mandates that education agency staff complete training on these parental rights and establishes a complaint procedure for investigating potential violations. If a school district or charter school is found in violation, the agency can withhold state funding, assess administrative penalties, or take other corrective actions.

The legislation also introduces new requirements for faculty councils or senates, making them strictly advisory and limiting their powers, and mandates more rigorous performance evaluations for tenured faculty. Additionally, the bill requires a systematic review of minor degree and certificate programs based on enrollment and workforce demand, and enhances training requirements for governing board members, including a requirement to provide a sworn statement affirming their understanding of duties.

Additionally, the bill stipulates that at least one governing board member must be a public representative with private business experience who has not held elected office. The bill allows sheriffs to become voting members upon request and agreement to comply with board standards, and prohibits employees of local mental health authorities from serving on their governing bodies. Notably, the bill also introduces a prohibition on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, preventing local mental health authorities from implementing practices that consider identity classifications in hiring, promotion, or resource allocation, except where required by federal law.

1868707	TX	HB5019	Relating to school district contracts with certain organizations and payroll deductions for school district employees.	AN ACT relating to school district contracts with certain organizations and payroll deductions for school district employees.	"This bill introduces several key changes to Texas education law regarding school district contracts, employee supports, and payroll deductions. The legislation creates a new state-managed system to provide school employees with resources and liability insurance through third-party contracts, while simultaneously prohibiting school districts from deducting dues for professional organizations. Specifically, the bill establishes that the state education agency must contract with third parties to offer services like explaining employee rights and providing liability insurance, with strict restrictions that these entities cannot engage in political activities or electioneering. The bill also prohibits school districts from deducting professional organization dues and restricts training providers from offering continuing education credits that involve political advocacy. Additionally, the legislation targets certain purchasing cooperatives and investment pools by defining and listing ""prohibited organizations"" that have lobbying connections, and requires school districts to develop transition plans if their current investment pools are managed by such organizations. The changes will primarily take effect for the 2026-2027 school year, with automatic transitions for existing payroll deductions and a requirement that school districts notify employees about the new system. The bill aims to limit political influence in educational organizations while providing alternative support mechanisms for school employees."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	29	1	Giovanni Capriglione (R)*	Employee Allegedly Engaged, Model Notice Form, Previously Exercised Deductions, Pay Periods Annually, Entity Providing Services, Provider Offering Training, Investment Pool Managed, Prohibited Purchasing Cooperatives, School District Employee, Including Liability Insurance	Education	49	Referred to Public Education	04/03/2025	03/17/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB5019	False	03/13/2025	03/17/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill amends the Texas Education Code to establish new standards for public school library materials, focusing on collection development policies. The standards require school libraries to review and update their policies every five years and prohibit the possession, acquisition, and purchase of materials that are: harmful (as defined in the Penal Code), rated as sexually explicit by vendors, pervasively vulgar or educationally unsuitable, or on the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's list of publications prohibited in correctional facilities. The bill emphasizes that obscene content is not protected by the First Amendment, recognizes parents as the primary decision-makers regarding student access to library materials, and encourages library catalog transparency and effective parent communication. Importantly, the bill also stipulates that materials cannot be removed solely based on the ideas contained within them or the personal background of the author or characters. These new standards will apply beginning with the 2025-2026 school year and will take effect immediately if approved by a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if not.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	30	1	Andy Hopper (R)*	Primary Decision Makers, Material Based Solely, Collection Development Policy, Including Material Contained, Library Material Included, Collection Development, Library Material, Ideas Contained, Harmful Material, Library Materials	Education	105	Referred to Public Education	04/03/2025	03/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB5021	False	03/13/2025	03/13/2025	Anti LGBT

"This bill prohibits political subdivisions (like local governments or municipalities) from spending public money to support professional associations that promote what the bill defines as ""diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives"" (DEI). The bill specifically defines these initiatives as efforts that: (1) centralize identity classifications (such as race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity) in understanding social disparities, (2) encourage organizational practices aimed at achieving proportional representation of identity groups, or (3) promote what the bill considers discriminatory treatment based on identity classifications. Under this proposed law, political subdivisions would be banned from paying membership fees or dues to such professional associations, and would also be prohibited from funding employee attendance at conferences or events hosted by these associations. The restrictions would apply to any expenditures made on or after the bill's effective date of September 1, 2025, effectively limiting local governments' ability to engage with or support professional organizations that pursue DEI-related activities as defined in the bill."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	18	2	Joanne Shofner (R)*, Mike Olcott (R)	Local Government Code, Promotes Discriminatory Treatment, Spend Public Money, Identity Classification Groups, Public Money, Identity  Classifications, Identity Classification, Inclusion Initiatives, Political Disparities, Understanding Social	Government Affairs	82	Referred to State Affairs	04/07/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB5158	False	03/14/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill addresses the governance of public higher education institutions in Texas by introducing several key provisions. First, it establishes guidelines for faculty councils or senates, specifying that these bodies can only be created by a governing board, are advisory in nature, and cannot have final decision-making authority. The bill mandates that faculty council meetings must be open to the public, with at least 72 hours' notice posted online and in student newspapers, and all votes must be recorded and made public. Additionally, the bill prohibits institutions from requiring courses that promote certain ideas about race, privilege, or differential treatment based on race or ethnicity, with narrow exceptions for specific academic contexts like ethnic studies, historical discussions of discrimination, and medical or scientific research. The legislation also affirms that the institution's governing board has final authority over degree programs and curricula, and allows boards to remove courses from their comprehensive list if they have not been taught for two consecutive academic years. Existing faculty councils or senates will be abolished by October 1, 2025, unless they are ratified by the institution's governing board or established in compliance with the new guidelines.

AN ACT relating to the creation of the office of inspector general, appointed by the State Board of Education, with jurisdiction to investigate allegations of public school employee misconduct.	This bill creates a new Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the State Board of Education to investigate allegations of public school employee misconduct. The inspector general will be appointed by the State Board of Education for a four-year term, with a maximum total service of 12 years, and can only be removed for cause by a unanimous board vote. The office will have broad investigative powers, including the ability to attend school district meetings, inspect records (even those not typically public), and issue subpoenas to compel witness testimony or document production. The bill requires the office to maintain strict confidentiality of misconduct allegations and protects individuals who report misconduct from retaliation. The OIG can refer matters to local law enforcement and will issue reports detailing investigation findings and recommended actions. The office is specifically authorized to investigate specific types of employee misconduct as defined in existing education code sections, and the bill amends other sections of the education code to incorporate the new inspector general's investigative authorities. The new office is intended to provide independent oversight of potential misconduct in public schools, with the first inspector general to be appointed as soon as practicable after the bill's effective date of September 1, 2025.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	3	1	0	21	1	David Lowe (R)*	Assessment Instruments Administered, Decreased Academic Performance, Alleged Inaccurate Data, Authorize Special Investigations, Federal Program Requirements, High School Campus, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Established Compliance Reviews, Including Electronic Data, Special Education Programs	Education	26	Referred to Public Education	04/07/2025	03/18/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB5406	False	03/14/2025	03/19/2025	Anti LGBT

The proposed provisions are nearly identical across different types of library systems, with each section specifying that librarians are forbidden from displaying such materials in their respective library settings.

The program will provide funding to eligible parents to pay for various education-related expenses such as private school tuition, online courses, textbooks, tutoring, educational therapy, technology, and transportation. To participate, children must be eligible to attend a public school or prekindergarten program and meet certain income-based criteria. The program will prioritize enrollment for siblings of current participants and children with disabilities, with a sliding scale based on household income. For each participating child, the state will transfer funds equivalent to approximately 85% of the statewide average per-student funding, with additional funding for children with disabilities (up to $30,000 annually). The comptroller will oversee the program, including selecting educational assistance organizations to administer accounts, preapproving educational service providers and vendors, and conducting annual audits. The program is set to begin in the 2026-2027 school year, with an initial spending cap of $1 billion for the first biennium, and includes provisions for transparency, accountability, and protecting the educational and religious autonomy of participating providers and families.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	199	4	25	125	90	Brandon Creighton (R)*, Paul Bettencourt (R)*, Donna Campbell (R)*, Brent Hagenbuch (R)*, Adam Hinojosa (R)*, Phil King (R)*, Mayes Middleton (R)*, Tan Parker (R)*, Angela Paxton (R)*, Brad Buckley (R)*, Brian Birdwell (R), Pete Flores (R), Kelly Hancock (R), Charles Schwertner (R), Kevin Sparks (R), Daniel Alders (R), Trent Ashby (R), Cecil Bell (R), Keith Bell (R), Greg Bonnen (R), Ben Bumgarner (R), Angie Button (R), Briscoe Cain (R), Giovanni Capriglione (R), David Cook (R), Tom Craddick (R), Charles Cunningham (R), Pat Curry (R), Mano DeAyala (R), Mark Dorazio (R), Paul Dyson (R), Caroline Fairly (R), James Frank (R), Gary Gates (R), Stan Gerdes (R), Cody Harris (R), Caroline Harris Davila (R), Richard Hayes (R), Cole Hefner (R), Hillary Hickland (R), Janis Holt (R), Andy Hopper (R), Lacey Hull (R), Todd Hunter (R), Carrie Isaac (R), Helen Kerwin (R), Stan Kitzman (R), Marc LaHood (R), Brooks Landgraf (R), Jeff Leach (R), Terri Leo-Wilson (R), Mitch Little (R), Janie Lopez (R), A.J.

AN ACT relating to a period of prayer and reading of the Bible or other religious text in public schools.	This bill allows public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in Texas to establish a daily period for prayer and reading of religious texts, but with several important restrictions and requirements. School boards must first pass a specific resolution and then implement a policy that mandates obtaining signed consent forms from employees and students' parents or guardians before participation. The consent form must acknowledge the voluntary nature of participation, waive the right to legal claims, and explicitly state no objection to the activity. The prayer or religious text reading cannot be conducted over a public address system, must not substitute instructional time, and must be carefully managed to prevent exposure to students or employees who have not provided consent. Participants may revoke their consent at any time, and the policy must ensure that those without consent are not inadvertently exposed to the religious activity. The bill also specifies that the prayer period could occur before school hours, only in classrooms where all participants have consented, or through other methods recommended by legal counsel. The Texas Attorney General is required to provide guidance and legal defense for school districts implementing such policies, with the state potentially covering legal expenses. Importantly, the bill does not prohibit individual voluntary, silent prayer during non-designated times, maintaining existing protections for students' personal religious expression.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	25	3	4	39	20	Mayes Middleton (R)*, Paul Bettencourt (R)*, Brian Birdwell (R)*, Donna Campbell (R)*, Brandon Creighton (R)*, Pete Flores (R)*, Brent Hagenbuch (R)*, Bob Hall (R)*, Kelly Hancock (R)*, Adam Hinojosa (R)*, Joan Huffman (R)*, Bryan Hughes (R)*, Phil King (R)*, Lois Kolkhorst (R)*, Robert Nichols (R)*, Tan Parker (R)*, Angela Paxton (R)*, Charles Perry (R)*, Charles Schwertner (R)*, Kevin Sparks (R)*	Public Address System, Normal School Hours, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Model Consent Form, New Consent Form, Signed Consent Form, Attorney General Defends, Entire School District, Public School Student, Consent Form	Education	241	Received from the Senate	03/19/2025	03/18/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB11	True	02/10/2025	02/11/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill establishes comprehensive provisions aimed at expanding parental rights and regulating educational practices in Texas public schools. It requires school districts to obtain parental consent for various activities, including human sexuality instruction and student club participation, and prohibits instruction or programming related to sexual orientation and gender identity for students in prekindergarten through 12th grade. The bill mandates that schools cannot infringe on parents' fundamental rights to direct their children's moral, religious, and educational training, and can only do so if absolutely necessary and using the least restrictive means. It also introduces new requirements for school districts, including developing parental engagement policies, providing detailed information about parental rights, and establishing grievance procedures. Additionally, the bill restricts diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) duties in schools, preventing employees from promoting or implementing DEI-related policies or statements. Schools must now annually certify their compliance with these new regulations, and the bill provides mechanisms for parents to challenge school decisions through a structured grievance process.

The legislation aims to restrict funding for municipal libraries that host such events, effectively using financial penalties to discourage what the bill's proponents might view as inappropriate entertainment for children.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	30	3	5	34	20	Bryan Hughes (R)*, Paul Bettencourt (R)*, Brian Birdwell (R)*, Donna Campbell (R)*, Brandon Creighton (R)*, Pete Flores (R)*, Brent Hagenbuch (R)*, Bob Hall (R)*, Kelly Hancock (R)*, Adam Hinojosa (R)*, Joan Huffman (R)*, Phil King (R)*, Lois Kolkhorst (R)*, Mayes Middleton (R)*, Robert Nichols (R)*, Tan Parker (R)*, Angela Paxton (R)*, Charles Perry (R)*, Charles Schwertner (R)*, Kevin Sparks (R)*	Local Government Code, Prohibiting Municipal Libraries, Municipal Libraries, Municipal Library, Library Hosts, Man Presenting, Man Reads, Opposite Gender, Public Funding, Public Funds	Government Affairs	399	Referred to State Affairs	04/09/2025	03/19/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB18	False	02/21/2025	03/18/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the use by a political subdivision of public funds for lobbying and certain other activities.	This bill restricts how political subdivisions (like counties) can use public funds for lobbying activities. Specifically, political subdivisions are prohibited from spending public money to hire registered lobbyists to lobby state legislators or to pay nonprofit associations that primarily represent political subdivisions and contract with lobbyists. However, the bill does allow some exceptions, such as allowing elected officers and employees to provide information to legislators, appear before legislative committees, and advocate for or against legislation without triggering lobbyist registration requirements. The bill also provides that taxpayers or residents can seek injunctive relief and recover attorney's fees if a political subdivision violates these restrictions. Additionally, the bill modifies existing law regarding county associations, removing language about influencing legislation and maintaining prohibitions on political campaign contributions. The new restrictions will apply to expenditures made on or after September 1, 2025, and any contract terms that conflict with the new law will be considered void on that date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	52	3	12	19	13	Mayes Middleton (R)*, Paul Bettencourt (R)*, Donna Campbell (R)*, Brandon Creighton (R)*, Pete Flores (R)*, Brent Hagenbuch (R)*, Bob Hall (R)*, Adam Hinojosa (R)*, Phil King (R)*, Tan Parker (R)*, Angela Paxton (R)*, Charles Schwertner (R)*, Joan Huffman (R)	Public Funds Related, Local Government Code, Organization Supported Wholly, Spend Public Funds, Public Funds, Government Code, Public Office, Individual Required, Legislation Pending, Providing Information	Government Affairs	187	Referred to State Affairs	03/25/2025	03/20/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB19	True	02/20/2025	03/13/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the governance of public institutions of higher education, including review of curriculum and certain degree and certificate programs, a faculty council or senate, training for members of the governing board, and the establishment of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Office of the Ombudsman; authorizing a civil penalty.	This bill introduces comprehensive changes to the governance of public higher education institutions in Texas, focusing on several key areas. It requires governing boards to conduct a thorough review of general education curricula every five years, ensuring courses are foundational, prepare students for civic and professional life, and do not include what the bill describes as divisive ideological content. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board must now conduct periodic reviews of degree programs, rating them based on return on investment and student debt levels, with low-performing programs potentially facing sanctions or elimination. The bill establishes new guidelines for faculty councils, limiting their role to advisory functions and creating strict rules for their composition and operation. It also strengthens the authority of institutional presidents and governing boards by giving them more direct oversight of curriculum, hiring, and program decisions. Additionally, the bill creates a new Office of the Ombudsman within the Higher Education Coordinating Board to investigate potential compliance issues at institutions, with the power to report unresolved violations to the attorney general. The legislation also mandates more comprehensive training for governing board members and requires annual reporting on institutional decisions, ultimately aiming to increase transparency, accountability, and alignment with state educational priorities.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	16	2	0	33	3	Brandon Creighton (R)*, Brian Birdwell (R), Brent Hagenbuch (R)	Ensures Adequate Representation, Family Educational Rights, Internet Live Video, Curriculum Proposals Reviewed, Associate Presiding Officer, Standing Legislative Committee, Higher Education Conducts, Board Considers Important, Determine Recommended Thresholds, Teaches Identity Politics	Education	141	Placed on intent calendar	04/10/2025	04/08/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB37	True	03/13/2025	03/13/2025	Anti LGBT
1752039	TX	SB80	Relating to the Texas Sovereignty Act.	AN ACT relating to the Texas Sovereignty Act.	This bill establishes the Texas Sovereignty Act, which creates a new mechanism for the state to challenge and potentially nullify federal actions it considers unconstitutional. The bill creates a 12-member Joint Legislative Committee on Constitutional Enforcement, composed of six representatives from the Texas House and six from the Texas Senate, tasked with reviewing federal laws, executive orders, court decisions, and other federal actions to determine their constitutionality. The committee would evaluate these actions by examining the original intent of the U.S. Constitution, including historical documents like ratifying debates and early congressional understandings. If the committee determines a federal action is unconstitutional, they would submit this finding to the Texas Supreme Court for review. If the Supreme Court agrees, the full legislature would vote on the matter, and if a majority declares the action unconstitutional, the state would effectively nullify that federal action within Texas, prohibiting state and local governments from spending resources to implement it and potentially allowing state officials to prevent its enforcement. The bill also adds a provision to the Civil Practice and Remedies Code allowing Texas courts to issue declaratory judgments about unconstitutional federal actions, with courts instructed to rely on the original understanding of the Constitution rather than previous court interpretations. Ultimately, the bill aims to assert state sovereignty and provide a mechanism for Texas to resist federal actions it believes exceed constitutional limits.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	15	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Year Terms Beginning, Forward Official Copies, Incur Public Debt, Spend Public Money, Specific Powers Enumerated, Federal Agency Rule, Grant Declaratory Relief, Enumerated Powers Delegated, Written Opinion Determining, Federal Government Established	Government Affairs	290	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB80	True	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

"This bill proposes to establish a strict biological definition of ""male"" and ""female"" for use in Texas government documents and publications, based on reproductive system characteristics. The bill begins with legislative findings that emphasize biological differences between sexes, including physiological distinctions related to reproduction, physical strength, and vulnerability to violence. It defines ""female"" as an individual with a reproductive system capable of producing ova, and ""male"" as an individual with a reproductive system capable of fertilizing ova. The legislation mandates that all government documents, policies, surveys, questionnaires, reports, publications, notices, and other written or electronic materials produced by governmental entities can only reference two sexes (male and female) when requesting or providing information about an individual's sex. The bill specifically states that an individual's sex is defined as their biological sex at birth and aims to address what the legislature perceives as inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives regarding sex definitions. The provisions are set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and appear to be designed to limit recognition of gender identities beyond the binary male-female classification in official state documentation."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	59	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Electronic Material Produced, Historically Suffered Discrimination, Including Sexual Violence, Sexes Leave Females, Biological Differences, Breastfeed Children, Experience Puberty, Government Documents, Individuals Age, Manifest Prior	Government Affairs	294	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB84	True	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to parental rights in public education and prohibiting instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity for public school students.	This bill establishes several new parental rights and restrictions in Texas public education, focusing on parents' involvement in and access to information about their children's schooling. The legislation requires school districts to create a grievance procedure that allows parents to file complaints and potentially pursue civil action if issues are not resolved within 30 days, with the potential for courts to award damages and attorneys' fees. The bill mandates that schools notify parents about any changes in services related to a student's mental, emotional, or physical health, and prohibits school employees from discouraging parental knowledge or involvement in critical decisions affecting a student's well-being. Additionally, the bill explicitly prohibits instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity in schools and requires parental written consent for students to participate in clubs that promote themes of sexuality, gender, or gender identity. Schools must also provide parents with information about a student's perception of their biological sex and obtain consent before administering student support forms or health-related services. The provisions will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year and apply to both traditional public schools and open-enrollment charter schools, with various state educational agencies required to review and potentially revise guidelines to ensure compliance with the new law.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	5	1	0	93	2	Bob Hall (R)*, Kevin Sparks (R)	Class Size Limits, Conduct Constituting Assault, Early Childhood Literacy, Endogenous Hormone Profiles, Mathematics Proficiency Plans, Military Readiness Plans, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Criminal History Records, Prohibit Parental Knowledge, Supportive Learning Environment	Education	189	Co-author authorized	04/08/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB86	True	11/12/2024	01/28/2025	Anti LGBT

Specifically, the school district must request written consent from parents at least 14 days before the instruction begins, and this consent request cannot be combined with any other notification or consent form. The bill will apply starting in the 2025-2026 school year and will take effect either immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the immediate voting threshold. By requiring explicit parental consent that is separate from other communications, the bill aims to give parents more direct control and awareness of when their children will receive human sexuality education in public schools.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	5	1	0	33	2	Bob Hall (R)*, Kevin Sparks (R)	Human Sexuality Instruction, Written Consent Provided, Written Consent, Education Code, Notice Provided, Parental Approval, Public Schools, School District, School Year, Provided	Education	96	Co-author authorized	04/08/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB87	True	11/12/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

The revised definition maintains three key criteria for determining harmful material: (1) material that appeals to a minor's prurient interest in sex, nudity, or excretion; (2) material that is patently offensive according to prevailing adult community standards regarding what is suitable for minors; and (3) material without redeeming social value for minors. The bill includes a standard legal provision specifying that these changes will only apply to offenses committed on or after the effective date (September 1, 2025), meaning that offenses committed before this date will be governed by the previous version of the law.

The bill also adds a specific defense for judicial or law enforcement officers who are performing their official duties. In a separate section addressing sexual offenses involving children, the bill eliminates several specific justifications for such conduct (including educational, medical, psychological, and legislative purposes) and narrows the acceptable defenses to three scenarios: being married to the child at the time of the offense, acting for a judicial or law enforcement purpose, or being no more than two years older than the child.

1751520	TX	SB93	Relating to complaint information and to rulemaking and disciplinary procedures of the Texas Medical Board.	AN ACT relating to complaint information and to rulemaking and disciplinary procedures of the Texas Medical Board.	This bill modifies the rulemaking and complaint procedures for the Texas Medical Board (TMB), introducing several key changes. The bill requires the TMB to hold public hearings before adopting rules, with exceptions for emergency rules. It significantly restricts who can file complaints against medical license holders, limiting complaints to patients, those directly involved in a patient's care, or individuals with direct personal knowledge of an incident. The bill mandates that complaints from non-patients must be in writing and include a sworn affidavit attesting to the truthfulness of the complaint. The TMB must now complete complaint investigations within 120 days, with a possible 30-day extension, and is generally prohibited from investigating complaints about incidents older than three years or involving patients who were minors at the time, unless specific conditions are met. The bill also changes the expert physician review process, requiring five expert reviewers from the same medical specialty to independently review complaints and vote on whether a physician's actions fall below an acceptable standard of care. Notably, disciplinary action can only be taken if at least three-fourths of the expert reviewers determine that the physician's actions were below standard. Additionally, the bill modifies rules around informal settlement conferences and removes the board's previous ability to appeal administrative law judge findings, requiring the board to issue a final order based on those findings.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	29	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Extenuating Circumstances Prevent, Sign Prominently Displayed, Rules Governing Appointment, Board Randomly Select, Provided Separate Copies, Regular Telephone Number, Subsequent Legal Proceeding, Expert Physician Panel, Complaint Involving Conduct, Emergency Rule Adopted	Health and Social Services	147	Referred to Health & Human Services	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB93	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

Additionally, the bill mandates that school district employees must obtain written parental consent before conducting psychological examinations, administering student well-being questionnaires or health screening forms, or recording a child's image or voice, with an exception for examinations or treatments required by special education laws or state and federal regulations. The legislation aims to increase parental involvement and transparency in their children's educational experience by ensuring parents have comprehensive access to their child's school-related information and providing them with more control over certain evaluative or documentary processes.

This bill modifies the Texas Education Code to strengthen parental consent requirements for school district employees and contractors regarding psychological examinations, tests, treatments, and recordings of children. The bill expands the existing consent law by explicitly including school district contractors alongside employees and requiring written informed consent each time before conducting psychological or psychiatric examinations, tests, or treatments. The bill provides detailed definitions of what constitutes a psychological or psychiatric examination, test, or treatment, which broadly includes surveys, screenings, or methods embedded in academic lessons that seek to elicit information about a child's attitudes, feelings, or mental state. The legislation clarifies that employees and contractors can still verbally inquire about a child's general well-being and conduct academic lessons that do not directly probe into a child's mental or emotional state. The bill maintains existing exceptions for consent, such as recordings for safety, extracurricular activities, classroom instruction, media coverage, and student safety purposes. Additionally, the bill requires school districts to retain the written informed consent as part of the child's educational records.

AN ACT relating to civil liability for, governmental health plan coverage of, and public funding for gender modification procedures and treatments.	This bill proposes comprehensive restrictions on gender modification medical procedures and treatments in Texas, focusing on three main areas: civil liability, government health plan coverage, and public funding. The bill defines gender modification procedures broadly, including surgeries like castration, hysterectomy, and hormone treatments that alter biological sex characteristics. It introduces strict liability for health insurers and medical providers, meaning they can be held financially responsible for lifetime medical costs associated with these procedures. The legislation prohibits governmental entities from using public funds for such treatments and bars specific state health plans (including Medicaid and child health plans) from covering gender modification procedures. However, the bill provides exceptions for individuals born with verified genetic disorders of sex development or those who do not have typical sex chromosome structures. The bill creates new legal frameworks that impose significant financial risks on healthcare providers and insurers offering these treatments, effectively making it extremely challenging to access gender modification procedures in Texas. The provisions will take effect on September 1, 2025, and apply to health benefit plans and potential legal actions from that date forward. The legislative findings suggest the bill is motivated by concerns about potential financial motivations in the medical community and potential long-term health impacts of such procedures.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	75	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Diseased Body Part, Health Care Facilities, Health Care Provider, Gender Modification Procedure, Gender Modification Procedures, Health Care Procedure, Health Benefit Plan, Public Money Sec, Basic Coverage Plan, Basic Plan	Government Affairs	305	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB115	False	11/12/2024	11/13/2024	Anti LGBT

This bill modifies the statute of limitations for health care liability claims specifically related to gender modification medical treatments for minors. Under the proposed law, for claims involving puberty suppression drugs, cross-sex hormones, gender transition surgeries, or other medical procedures performed on a minor, the statute of limitations is extended until the claimant turns 30 years old, provided the claim is based on malpractice and the claimant was a minor when the medical treatment occurred. This is a significant change from the previous general statute of limitations, which typically required claims to be filed within two years of the medical treatment or by a minor's 14th birthday, and mandated that all health care liability claims be brought within 10 years of the act or omission. The bill will apply only to causes of action that accrue on or after September 1, 2025, giving specific legal recourse to individuals who received gender modification medical treatments as minors, allowing them a longer period to potentially file a medical malpractice claim.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	46	2	Bob Hall (R)*, Mayes Middleton (R)*	Health Care Treatment, Gender Modification Drugs, Gender Reassignment, Gender Transitioning, Cross-Sex  Hormone, Legal Disability, Remedies Code, General Statute, Medical  Procedure, Procedures Performed	Government Affairs	218	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB116	False	11/12/2024	11/13/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to studies or surveys on children's sexual behavior conducted at or by a public primary or secondary school, a public institution of higher education, a prescription drug manufacturer, a research entity, or another person; creating criminal offenses; imposing civil penalties.	This bill prohibits conducting studies or surveys about children's sexual behavior in various educational and research settings, imposing strict criminal and civil penalties for violations. Specifically, the bill prevents school districts, institutions of higher education, prescription drug manufacturers, and research entities from conducting studies or surveys about a child's sexual behavior without explicit written consent from a parent or guardian. If someone violates these prohibitions, they would commit a state jail felony and face civil penalties ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 for each child unlawfully included in the study or survey. The attorney general is authorized to investigate potential violations and pursue civil penalties. The bill requires that if any information disclosed during such a study indicates child abuse or neglect, it must be reported according to existing family code guidelines. The provisions apply broadly across public schools, higher education institutions, and research entities, creating a comprehensive prohibition on unauthorized studies of children's sexual behavior. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, giving institutions time to adjust their research practices to comply with the new restrictions.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	19	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Creating Criminal Offenses, Imposing Civil Penalties, Sexual Behavior Conducted, Sexual Behavior, Criminal Penalty, Civil  Penalty, Civil Penalty, Higher Education, Public Primary, Secondary School	Health and Social Services	134	Referred to Health & Human Services	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB126	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the designation and use of certain spaces and facilities according to biological sex; authorizing a civil penalty and a private civil right of action.	This bill, known as the Texas Women's Privacy Act, establishes detailed regulations regarding the use of multiple-occupancy private spaces (such as restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms) in state and local government facilities based on an individual's biological sex. The bill defines biological sex as the physical condition determined by sex organs, chromosomes, and original birth certificate, and requires that these spaces be designated exclusively for individuals of the same biological sex. Political subdivisions and state agencies must take reasonable steps to prevent individuals from using spaces designated for a different biological sex, with some limited exceptions for custodial, maintenance, emergency, or caregiving purposes. The bill imposes civil penalties of $5,000 for a first violation and $25,000 for subsequent violations, and allows residents to file complaints with the Attorney General. Additionally, the bill creates a private civil right of action for individuals affected by violations, enabling them to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The bill also includes a unique fee-shifting provision that would require anyone seeking to prevent enforcement of biological sex-based space regulations to potentially pay the legal costs of the prevailing party.

The bill specifically defines a ""sexually oriented business"" as a commercial establishment like a nightclub, bar, or restaurant that provides live nude entertainment to an audience of two or more people, and defines ""nude"" as either being entirely unclothed or wearing clothing that exposes breasts, genitals, or buttocks. The legislation creates a criminal offense for business operators who allow alcohol consumption or possession on their premises, with escalating penalties for repeat offenses: a first offense is a Class A misdemeanor, a second offense is a state jail felony, and a third or subsequent offense is a third-degree felony. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, and aims to restrict alcohol consumption in venues featuring nude entertainment."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	15	2	0	14	2	Borris Miles (D)*, Charles Perry (R)	Fully Opaque Clothing, Sexually Oriented Businesses, Similar Commercial Enterprise, Bring Alcoholic Beverages, Consume Alcoholic Beverages, Live Nude Performances, Sexually Oriented Business, Alcoholic Beverage Code, Alcoholic  Beverages, Alcoholic Beverages	Government Affairs	67	Withdrawn by the Author	04/01/2025	04/01/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB287	False	11/12/2024	11/15/2024	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the protection of expressive activities at public institutions of higher education.	This bill amends the Texas Education Code to strengthen protections for expressive activities and student organizations at public institutions of higher education. The bill prohibits higher education institutions from taking action against or denying benefits to student organizations based on their political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic viewpoints, or based on the organization's requirements for leadership and membership, such as affirming the organization's beliefs or complying with its standards of conduct. The bill provides a mechanism for individuals or student organizations to seek legal recourse if their expressive rights are violated, allowing them to file for a declaratory judgment or an injunction within one year of the alleged violation. Each day a violation continues is considered a separate violation, and individuals can raise these violations as a defense or counterclaim in civil, administrative, or disciplinary proceedings. Importantly, the bill waives the institution's sovereign immunity, allowing students and organizations to sue the institution for violations of these expressive rights. The bill will take effect on September 1, 2025, and will only apply to causes of action that accrue on or after that date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	15	1	Charles Perry (R)*	Academic Viewpoint Expressed, Disciplinary Proceedings Brought, Sincerely Held Beliefs, Allegedly  Violated, Benefit Generally, Education Code, Expressive Rights, Higher Education, Public Institutions, Student Organizations	Government Affairs	116	Referred to State Affairs	02/03/2025	11/12/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB306	True	11/12/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to parental approval for a student's participation in human sexuality instruction in public schools.	This bill modifies the Texas Education Code to require school districts to obtain explicit written parental consent before providing students with human sexuality instruction. Specifically, the bill mandates that schools must obtain a standalone written consent form from parents at least 14 days before the human sexuality instruction begins, and this consent request cannot be combined with any other notification or consent form. The new requirement will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, giving schools time to prepare for the change. The bill will become law immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in both legislative chambers, or otherwise will take effect on September 1, 2025. This legislation appears aimed at increasing parental involvement and control over their children's sexual education curriculum by ensuring parents have advance notice and must provide explicit permission before their child can participate in such instruction.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	37	3	4	33	10	Donna Campbell (R)*, Paul Bettencourt (R), Brandon Creighton (R), Pete Flores (R), Bob Hall (R), Bryan Hughes (R), Phil King (R), Lois Kolkhorst (R), Mayes Middleton (R), Kevin Sparks (R)	Human Sexuality Instruction, Written Consent Provided, Written Consent, Education Code, Notice Provided, Parental Approval, Public Schools, School District, School Year, Provided	Education	112	Referred to Public Education	04/09/2025	04/01/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB371	True	11/14/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to a period of prayer and reading of the Bible or other religious text in public schools.	This bill allows school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in Texas to establish a daily period for prayer and religious text reading, with several key provisions. Schools can adopt this policy through a formal board vote, but participation is strictly voluntary and requires signed consent from employees or students' parents/guardians. The consent form must acknowledge the voluntary nature of participation and include a waiver releasing the school from potential legal claims. The religious reading or prayer cannot be broadcast over a public address system, must not interfere with instructional time, and must be conducted in a manner that prevents students without consent from being exposed to the activity. The bill mandates that schools can provide this period before normal school hours, in classrooms where all participants have consented, or through other methods recommended by legal counsel. Participants can revoke their consent at any time, and the policy does not prevent individual students from privately praying or reading religious texts during non-designated times. The Texas Attorney General is required to provide guidance to schools implementing this policy and can defend schools against potential legal challenges. The bill will apply starting in the 2025-2026 school year and requires school boards to take a formal vote on adopting the policy within six months of the act's effective date.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	5	1	0	30	2	Mayes Middleton (R)*, Donna Campbell (R)	Public Address System, Normal School Hours, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Model Consent Form, New Consent Form, Signed Consent Form, Attorney General Defends, Public School Student, Consent Form, Attorney General	Education	87	Co-author authorized	02/26/2025	11/15/2024	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB380	True	11/15/2024	02/28/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill amends the Texas Education Code to require explicit written parental consent before a school district employee can conduct psychological or psychiatric examinations, tests, or treatments involving a student. The bill broadly defines these activities as methods designed to elicit information about a student's attitudes, habits, mental states, or behaviors, including surveys, screenings, or activities embedded in academic lessons. Parents must sign and return a consent form before a child can participate in such activities, and the child cannot participate without the signed consent. The bill clarifies that employees do not need parental consent to verbally ask a child about their general well-being and does not affect existing laws regarding a child's ability to consent to counseling or the mandatory reporting of child abuse. The provisions will apply starting with the 2025-2026 school year, and the bill will take effect either immediately upon receiving a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the necessary immediate voting support.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	35	3	4	30	9	Lois Kolkhorst (R)*, Donna Campbell (R), Brandon Creighton (R), Pete Flores (R), Brent Hagenbuch (R), Bob Hall (R), Adam Hinojosa (R), Joan Huffman (R), Kevin Sparks (R)	Requiring Parental Consent, Signed Written Consent, Report Child Abuse, School District Employee, Written Consent, Child Abuse, School District, School Year, Education Code, Special Education	Education	127	Referred to Public Education	04/09/2025	03/24/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB400	True	11/20/2024	01/30/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill establishes new requirements for recording biological sex on birth certificates in Texas, mandating that birth certificates must include a space for recording a person's biological sex as either male or female, determined by sex organs, chromosomes, or endogenous profile. The bill allows an exception for newborns with atypical or ambiguous sex characteristics, where a physician can delay sex designation until the child's sex can be definitively determined. Birth certificates can only be amended to change or complete sex information under specific circumstances: correcting a clerical error, listing a previously unrecorded biological sex, or updating the sex for a person born with ambiguous characteristics. The bill prohibits changing a birth certificate's biological sex designation except in very narrow, medically-determined situations. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is required to adopt rules implementing these changes, with the bill set to take effect on September 1, 2025.

Health care facilities must develop written protocols to ensure patients can still access needed services when a provider declines to participate. The legislation prohibits adverse actions against providers who exercise their conscience rights, including discrimination in employment, licensing, certification, or educational opportunities. Providers who are subject to adverse actions or feel their rights have been violated can file complaints with licensing agencies or pursue civil actions seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees.

State agencies are forbidden from compelling employees to provide DEI statements, maintaining DEI offices, or hiring personnel specifically for DEI roles, except where required by federal law. The bill also modifies existing labor code provisions by removing language that previously allowed consideration of demographic factors in workforce diversity programs.

These requirements apply to a wide range of health insurance providers, including insurance companies, hospital service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and various state health programs, with some exceptions for self-funded plans governed by federal law. The bill will apply to health benefit plans delivered, issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, and will take effect on September 1, 2025. The legislation ensures that individuals who have undergone gender transition procedures will continue to receive comprehensive medical coverage for related health consequences, regardless of their current insurance enrollment status."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	14	2	0	85	3	Bryan Hughes (R)*, Bob Hall (R), Kevin Sparks (R)	Adverse Consequences Related, Nonprofit Agricultural Organization, Professional Employer Organization, Local Government Code, Health Benefit Plan, Gender Transition Procedure, Basic Coverage Plan, Accident Coverage Provided, Including Coverage Provided, Gender Transition	Health and Social Services	142	Co-author authorized	04/09/2025	04/07/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1257	True	02/13/2025	02/13/2025	Anti LGBT
1837637	TX	SB1392	Relating to newborn screening tests for sex chromosome structure.	AN ACT relating to newborn screening tests for sex chromosome structure.	This bill requires the Texas Department of State Health Services to include a sex chromosome structure test as part of its existing newborn screening program. Specifically, the bill mandates that the department incorporate this test into its detection and treatment program, heritable disease screening, and newborn screening services. The test will be added to the current suite of screenings performed on newborns, which aim to identify potential genetic or health conditions early. The Department of State Health Services is instructed to implement this new requirement as soon as practicable after the bill becomes law. The bill will take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or otherwise will become effective on September 1, 2025. The purpose appears to be to expand newborn screening capabilities to include more comprehensive testing of sex chromosome structures, potentially allowing for earlier detection of chromosomal variations or related genetic conditions.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	14	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Heritable Diseases Conducted, Sex Chromosome Structure, Treatment Program Established, Newborn Screening Tests, Safety Code, Screening, Amended, Health, Relating, Txsb	Health and Social Services	95	Referred to Health & Human Services	03/06/2025	02/19/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1392	False	02/19/2025	03/04/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to electronic health record requirements, including the recording of an individual's biological sex.	"This bill establishes new requirements for electronic health records (EHRs) in Texas, focusing on how an individual's biological sex is recorded and documented. The legislation defines key terms such as ""biological sex"" (the reproductive trait determining male or female gamete production), ""male,"" ""female,"" and ""sexual development disorder."" It mandates that health care providers must include a specific space in electronic health records to record an individual's biological sex as assigned at birth (either male or female) and any information about sexual development disorders. The bill requires that medical treatment decision-making algorithms in EHRs be based on the recorded biological sex. Amendments to the biological sex in a record are only permitted to correct clerical errors or if an individual is diagnosed with a sexual development disorder that warrants changing the recorded sex. While the bill allows additional spaces for recording gender identity information, it prioritizes biological sex documentation. The Texas Medical Board, state health commission, and Texas Department of Insurance are tasked with implementing these new requirements through joint rulemaking. The provisions will apply only to electronic health records prepared on or after the bill's effective date, which will be either immediately upon receiving a two-thirds legislative vote or September 1, 2025, if that threshold is not met."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	53	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Decision Tree Included, External Genital Structures, Sexual Development Disorder, Health Care Provider, Opposite Biological Sex, Electronic Health Record, Biological Sex Recorded, Biological Sex, Atypical Development, Biological Trait	Health and Social Services	164	Referred to Health & Human Services	03/06/2025	02/19/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1393	False	02/19/2025	02/19/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the membership of a school district's local school health advisory council.	This bill modifies the composition and operation of local school health advisory councils in Texas school districts by establishing new rules for member appointment, voting rights, and meeting procedures. Each school district trustee will now be required to appoint an equal number of council members, with members serving one-year renewable terms. The bill mandates that a majority of voting members must be parents of district students who are not employed by the district and do not have close relatives working in the district. These parent members will exclusively be eligible to serve in leadership roles like chair or secretary. The bill also allows districts to appoint nonvoting members from employee groups such as teachers, counselors, and administrators, and voting members from community groups like healthcare professionals, business representatives, law enforcement, senior citizens, clergy, nonprofit health organizations, and domestic violence programs. Additionally, the bill strengthens transparency requirements by mandating that councils post meeting notices 72 hours in advance, prepare detailed minutes, make audio or video recordings of meetings, and submit these materials to the district within 10 days, with the district then required to post these materials online. These changes will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, aiming to increase parental involvement and community representation in school health advisory councils.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	6	1	0	29	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Central Administrative Office, Mental Health Professionals, Nonprofit Health Organizations, Classroom Teachers Employed, School Administrators Employed, School Counselors Certified, School Year, School District, Education Code, Equal Number	Education	38	Scheduled for public hearing on . . .	04/15/2025	02/19/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1395	False	02/19/2025	02/28/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill amends Texas education law to prohibit the adoption and use of national sex education standards in public schools, specifically targeting standards developed by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. The bill modifies existing education code to prevent the State Board of Education from adopting these national standards and to ensure that school districts and charter schools are not required to offer any aspect of such curriculum. The legislation also strengthens existing requirements for sex education courses, mandating that they emphasize abstinence as the preferred behavior for unmarried school-age individuals, present abstinence as the most effective method for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, and direct adolescents towards abstinence before marriage. Additionally, the bill requires that any sexual health instruction must be selected by local school boards with input from health advisory councils and cannot be based on national sex education standards. The changes will take effect in the 2025-2026 school year, with the bill becoming law either immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature or on September 1, 2025, if it does not receive the required supermajority vote.	89th Legislature Regular Session	3	Crossed Over	False	28	3	4	57	4	Bob Hall (R)*, Donna Campbell (R), Mayes Middleton (R), Kevin Sparks (R)	Including Standards Developed, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Theoretical Laboratory Rates, Open-Enrollment Charter School, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Sex Education Initiative, Reality Rates, School Age, School District, School Year	Education	78	Received from the Senate	04/09/2025	04/08/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1396	False	02/19/2025	02/28/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the use by a county, municipality, or school district of public money for lobbying activities.	This bill establishes new restrictions on how counties, municipalities, and school districts can use public money for lobbying activities. Specifically, these local government entities are prohibited from spending public funds to directly or indirectly influence legislation pending before the Texas Legislature. However, the bill does allow several exceptions: government officers and employees can provide information to legislators, appear before legislative committees, and advocate for or against legislation under certain conditions. The bill permits reimbursing travel expenses for authorized activities and allows paying membership dues to nonprofit state associations that advocate on behalf of local governments. Importantly, taxpayers or residents can seek injunctive relief and recover attorney's fees if a local government violates these restrictions. The new rules will take effect on September 1, 2025, and apply to expenditures, payments, or establishment of nonprofit organizations made on or after that date. The bill aims to limit the use of taxpayer funds for lobbying efforts while still preserving some channels of communication between local governments and state legislators.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	11	1	Robert Nichols (R)*	School District Engages, Spending Public Money, School  District, School District, Public Money, School Districts, Governing  Body, Government Code, Legislation Pending, Providing Information	Government Affairs	33	Referred to State Affairs	03/06/2025	02/19/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1420	False	02/19/2025	02/28/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to a school district's grievance procedure and to certain public school requirements and prohibitions regarding instruction and diversity, equity, and inclusion duties and the loss of funding for public schools that fail to comply with those provisions.	"This bill introduces several significant changes to Texas education law, focusing on prohibiting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activities in public schools and establishing a detailed grievance procedure for parents. The bill defines ""diversity, equity, and inclusion duties"" as activities related to race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation in hiring, employment, policies, or training, and prohibits schools from assigning such duties to employees or contractors. Public schools and charter schools must now implement and comply with all required policies, and they are specifically barred from engaging in DEI-related activities except as necessary to comply with state or federal law. The bill establishes a comprehensive local grievance procedure that allows parents to file complaints about potential violations, with specific timelines for acknowledging and addressing grievances at the school, superintendent, and school board levels. Additionally, the bill requires school districts to annually certify their compliance with these new provisions to the state education agency, including describing how they've modified existing policies and any cost savings resulting from compliance. Schools that fail to comply may face potential funding implications, and superintendents of districts with multiple grievance findings may be required to testify before the State Board of Education.

This bill modifies several Texas state codes to require the recording of a person's biological sex as either male or female on various government documents, including birth certificates, death certificates, driver's licenses, and personal identification cards. Specifically, the bill mandates that birth certificates must include a space for recording a child's biological sex as determined by sex organs, chromosomes, or endogenous profile, with an exception for children born with atypical or ambiguous sex characteristics. The bill restricts amendments to these sex designations, allowing changes only in specific circumstances such as correcting clerical errors or documenting a previously undetermined sex. For driver's licenses and identification cards, the bill requires applicants to identify their biological sex as determined at birth. The changes will apply to new and renewed documents issued on or after the bill's effective date, which will be immediate if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas Legislature, or September 1, 2025, if not.

This bill requires school districts in Texas to notify parents via email each time their child checks out a library book, providing the title and author of the material. Parents will be given the option to opt out of these notifications before the start of each school year, and school districts must maintain an up-to-date list of parents to be notified and promptly process opt-out requests. The bill amends the Education Code to add this notification requirement to the list of provisions that apply to open-enrollment charter schools, ensuring that these schools must also comply with the new parent notification system. The new requirement will take effect for the 2025-2026 school year, giving school districts time to implement the necessary systems and processes.

This bill introduces several changes to how criminal offenses are handled on school property in Texas. It modifies existing laws to allow law enforcement officers to issue citations for certain school offenses, while also establishing new requirements for handling such incidents. The bill creates a new provision that prevents students who have been convicted of or placed on deferred adjudication for a school offense from graduating high school until they have completed all required community service and paid associated fines and costs. It also establishes a system of graduated sanctions for school districts, with some exceptions for offenses that pose an imminent threat to teacher safety or result in physical harm to a teacher. Additionally, the bill mandates that schools report detailed information about citations issued to students, including demographic data and specific offense details. Schools must submit an annual report to the state agency, which will then compile and publish this information. The legislation aims to provide a more structured approach to handling student misconduct, balancing disciplinary actions with opportunities for intervention and support, while ensuring transparency in how school-related offenses are addressed.

The bill requires that biological sex be recorded as either male or female on these documents, with a specific exception for newborns with atypical or ambiguous sex characteristics, where the birth certificate can be amended later when the child's sex is definitively determined. The legislation also prohibits changing the recorded biological sex on these documents to the opposite of the sex determined at birth, effectively preventing individuals from modifying their documented biological sex on official state identification. The changes will apply to new and renewed documents issued on or after the effective date of September 1, 2025, and require the Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules implementing these new requirements. The bill aims to standardize the recording of biological sex across various state-issued documents and limit the ability to alter this information.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	40	1	Donna Campbell (R)*	Distinguishing Number Assigned, Social Security Number, Amending Certificate Attached, Fetal Death Certificates, Federal Bankruptcy Judge, Commercial Motor Vehicle, Fetal Death Certificate, License Application Denied, Commercial Driver License, Issues Birth Certificates	Government Affairs	92	Referred to State Affairs	03/17/2025	03/05/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB1953	False	03/05/2025	03/06/2025	Anti LGBT

The legislation explicitly defines ""biological sex"" in the context of addressing individuals, though it does not provide a detailed definition in the text. Importantly, the bill includes a caveat that these protections do not authorize harassment or bullying, and schools and employers can still maintain policies to prevent such conduct. The bill applies to both public school systems (from K-12 through higher education) and broader public employment settings. If passed, the bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature, or otherwise on September 1, 2025.

AN ACT relating to the regulation of certain political communications, a prohibition on electioneering by school district and open-enrollment charter school officials and employees, and actions and other proceedings by a public school challenging the operations of the public school system; authorizing an administrative penalty; creating a criminal offense.	This bill introduces comprehensive regulations to prevent electioneering (political campaigning) by school district and charter school officials and employees. The legislation defines electioneering as posting political signs, endorsing or opposing measures before governmental bodies, and engaging in certain prohibited political activities. Key provisions include prohibiting school district and charter school employees from using public resources for political purposes, requiring reporting of potential violations, and establishing significant consequences for non-compliance. If an employee is found to have violated the electioneering prohibition, they may be added to a registry preventing them from working in public schools, with the duration of this restriction depending on their position (three years for superintendents, one year for other employees). The bill also restricts school districts and charter schools from contracting with individuals who have engaged in electioneering and limits their ability to initiate legal actions against state agencies. Violations can result in administrative penalties, potential criminal charges, and professional sanctions, including the possibility of losing educator certification. The legislation aims to ensure that public education resources and personnel remain politically neutral and focused on educational missions.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	36	1	Paul Bettencourt (R)*	Assessment Instruments Administered, Decreased Academic Performance, Financial Accountability Standard, Individual Graduation Committee, Internal Mail System, Social Media Platform, Academic Performance Standards, Good Faith Reports, High School Campus, Trustee Election Occurring	Government Affairs	38	Referred to State Affairs	03/17/2025	03/07/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2044	True	03/07/2025	03/07/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill aims to prohibit electric utilities, municipally owned utilities, and retail electric providers from establishing or maintaining diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices or initiatives that go beyond color-blind, race-neutral, and sex-neutral practices. The bill defines a DEI office as a unit within a utility that influences hiring practices based on race, sex, color, or ethnicity, promotes differential treatment, or conducts trainings related to identity characteristics. Specifically, utilities are prohibited from creating DEI offices or hiring employees to perform DEI-related duties, except when required by federal law or court orders. The bill allows individuals who believe a utility is violating these restrictions to file a complaint with the Attorney General, who can then take legal action. For electric utilities and retail providers, the Attorney General can seek to enjoin or require compliance, while for municipally owned utilities, the Attorney General can file a mandamus petition in the county where the utility is located to compel compliance.

This bill makes several changes to the governance and composition of local mental health authorities in Texas. It requires local mental health authorities to provide a monthly electronic expense report to all governing body members, including ex officio (non-voting) members. The bill modifies the composition of governing bodies by mandating that for single-county authorities, the county sheriff must be an ex officio member, and for multi-county authorities, two sheriffs (one from an above-median population county and one from a below-median population county) must serve as ex officio members. The bill introduces a new requirement that at least one governing board member must be a public business owner who has not held elected office. Sheriffs can now request to become voting members by agreeing to comply with board standards, and employees of the mental health authority are prohibited from serving on the governing body. Additionally, the bill introduces a prohibition on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, preventing local mental health authorities from implementing practices that promote representation based on identity classifications or give preferences in employment or participation based on race, color, religion, national origin, or ethnicity, except as required by federal law.

The reports must include extensive data such as the total number of embryos created, their ultimate disposition (including those destroyed, transferred, donated for research, or placed in cryopreservation), the number of pregnancies and live births resulting from ART procedures, and specifics about embryo transfers and potential losses. Providers must report reasons for embryo destruction, including genetic concerns, sex selection, or being unwanted, while ensuring no personally identifiable patient information is disclosed. The department is required to compile these reports into an annual public document published on their website by December 31st, which will provide comprehensive statewide statistics about ART procedures, including success rates broken down by various factors like patient age and use of donor gametes. Providers who fail to comply with these reporting requirements may face administrative penalties, including fines or other disciplinary actions.

"This bill establishes a framework for faith-based child-care facilities in Texas to provide care for foster youth, addressing the state's current shortage of foster care capacity. The bill defines a faith-based child-care facility as a 24-hour care facility owned and operated by a religious organization, with specific requirements for establishment. Religious organizations must develop a comprehensive care plan, create an employee training program, and contract with a mental health services provider. The facility must be overseen by a diverse committee including religious leaders, mental health professionals, child welfare experts, and local elected officials. The bill introduces a ""faith-family program"" that allows organization members to mentor foster youth, potentially leading to foster or adoptive placements. While exempted from traditional child-care facility licensing requirements, these facilities must still meet minimum standards set by the state department to ensure children's health and safety. The department will also establish a grant program to help religious organizations create these facilities and integrate them into the state's foster care system. Notably, the bill aims to leverage religious organizations' community resources and historical involvement in child welfare to provide nurturing environments for foster youth, with a focus on comprehensive support including mental health services and community mentorship."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	39	1	Mayes Middleton (R)*	Conducts Background Checks, Human Trafficking Alleged, Unique Operational Frameworks, Elected Official Serving, Encourage Individuals Serving, Faith-Based Child-Care Facilities, Private Child-Care Facilities, Respite Care Exclusively, Sanitation Standards Equal, Food Distribution Program	Health and Social Services	36	Referred to Health & Human Services	04/03/2025	03/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2534	True	03/13/2025	03/13/2025	Anti LGBT
1869082	TX	SB2614	Relating to certain requirements and penalties regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at a medical and dental unit.	AN ACT relating to certain requirements and penalties regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at a medical and dental unit.	This bill amends the Texas Education Code to modify regulations around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at medical and dental units within higher education institutions. Specifically, the bill adds a new provision that prohibits academic course instruction at medical and dental units from offering courses that could be considered divisive or discriminatory based on race, sex, color, or ethnicity. If the state auditor determines that a medical or dental unit has spent state money on academic course instruction that violates these guidelines, the institution will have 90 days to correct the violation and avoid financial penalties. The changes will take effect during the 2025-2026 academic year, and the bill becomes law immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote from both legislative chambers, or otherwise takes effect on September 1, 2025. The legislation is part of a broader effort to restrict DEI programming in Texas higher education, focusing specifically on medical and dental educational units and their course offerings.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	26	1	Brandon Creighton (R)*	Compliance Audit Conducted, Student Organization Registered, Student Recruitment, Dental Unit, Education Code, Guest Speakers, Higher Education, Inclusion Initiatives, Postgraduate Outcomes, Short-Term Engagements	Education	27	Referred to Education K-16	04/03/2025	03/13/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2614	False	03/13/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the review and evaluation of advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses offered in public schools in this state.	This bill requires the State Board of Education (SBOE) to conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of all Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses offered by public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in Texas by December 31, 2026. During this review, the SBOE will examine the courses' examination materials, instructional content, and training resources to ensure compliance with state educational laws, specifically Section 28.0022. Based on the findings of this review, the SBOE will determine whether each individual course may continue to be offered in Texas schools. The bill includes a sunset provision, meaning the review requirement will automatically expire on September 1, 2027, and the bill itself will take effect on September 1, 2025. The primary purpose appears to be ensuring that AP and IB courses meet state educational standards and are appropriate for students.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	15	1	Brandon Creighton (R)*	Open-Enrollment Charter School, International Baccalaureate Courses, International Baccalaureate, School District, School Districts, Advanced Placement, Including Examination, Public Schools, Training Materials, Education Code	Education	28	Referred to Education K-16	04/03/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2616	False	03/13/2025	03/15/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill establishes a new education savings account program in Texas where the state comptroller will create a program to provide funding for education-related expenses for participating children. Specifically, the bill adds Section 29.352 to Chapter 29 of the Texas Education Code, which authorizes the comptroller to set up a mechanism for allocating funds to support educational costs for certain students. The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in both legislative chambers, as specified by the Texas Constitution; otherwise, it will go into effect on September 1, 2025. While the bill text is brief and does not provide extensive details about eligibility, funding amounts, or specific allowable expenses, it represents the initial legislative framework for creating an education savings account program in the state.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	15	1	Brandon Creighton (R)*	Children Participating, Education Code, Provide Funding, Amended, Comptroller, Establishment, Program, Read, Relating, Txsb	Education	29	Referred to Education K-16	04/03/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2618	False	03/13/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to a prohibition on public institutions of higher education requiring students to enroll in certain courses to complete a certificate or degree program, using such courses to satisfy general education requirements, funding such courses using state appropriations, or requiring related faculty practices, and to freshman student orientation at those institutions.	This bill prohibits public higher education institutions in Texas from requiring students to take courses that discuss certain topics related to race, gender, and social justice, such as critical theory, systemic racism, intersectionality, and cultural competence. The bill restricts institutions from mandating courses or programming that explore these concepts as part of general education requirements or degree programs. Institutions cannot compel faculty to include such content in their courses or use it as a factor in performance evaluations. The bill allows exceptions for specific courses in racial, ethnic, or gender studies programs, provided these courses are not required for other degree requirements. Courses can still discuss historical instances of discrimination like slavery or the Holocaust, and medical or biological sciences can discuss genetic or physiological differences. The bill also stipulates that such courses cannot be funded by state appropriations and requires institutions to report their compliance to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board starting in the 2026 fiscal year. The provisions will take effect for the 2025-2026 academic year, with immediate implementation possible if the bill receives a two-thirds vote in the Texas legislature.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	63	1	Mayes Middleton (R)*	Contemporary American Society, Discussing Historical Movements, Curate Instructional Materials, Teaches Identity Politics, Freshman Student Orientation, Freshmen Student Orientation, Establishing Required Curricular, Programming Explicitly Required, Identifying Genetic Predispositions, Including White Supremacy	Education	55	Referred to Education K-16	04/03/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2714	True	03/13/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

This bill modifies the Texas Family Code by adding a new section that clarifies what does not constitute child abuse or neglect. Specifically, the bill states that a parent, legal guardian, or other caregiver cannot be considered abusive or neglectful if they refuse to affirm a child's sexual orientation or gender identity, or if they choose not to address the child by their preferred name or pronouns, even if the child has not legally changed their name. The new provision is designed to exclude these specific actions from the legal definition of abuse or neglect, which could potentially impact how child welfare cases are evaluated when parents do not support a child's gender identity or sexual orientation. The bill is set to take effect on September 1, 2025, giving time for legal professionals and child welfare agencies to understand and implement the new provision.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	32	1	Bob Hall (R)*	Expressed Sexual Orientation, Family Code, Gender Identity, Legal Guardian, Legally  Changed, Abuse, Definition, Neglect, Relating, Txsb	Health and Social Services	60	Referred to Health & Human Services	04/03/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2749	True	03/13/2025	03/15/2025	Anti LGBT

AN ACT relating to the inclusion of an understanding of communist regimes, ideologies and history and their connection to DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) and anti-racist initiatives in the essential knowledge and skills for the social studies curriculum for public school students.	"This bill requires Texas public schools to incorporate a specific curriculum about communism, Marxist philosophies, and contemporary social justice movements into their social studies courses, starting in the 2026-2027 school year. The curriculum mandates that students learn about the history of communism in the United States, including domestic communist movements, and analyze the philosophical foundations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Students will be required to explore the works of philosophers like Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse, discuss the origins and development of Cultural Marxism and Critical Theory, and examine the ideological roots of CRT and DEI. The bill directs students to critically analyze the concepts of intersectionality, the ""pedagogy of the oppressed,"" and the potential consequences of these philosophical frameworks on traditional American ideals of liberty, self-government, and individual merit. The State Board of Education is required to review and revise the social studies curriculum by June 1, 2026, to ensure compliance with these new requirements, with the bill taking effect either immediately upon receiving a two-thirds legislative vote or on September 1, 2025, if immediate implementation is not approved."	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	4	1	0	42	1	Brent Hagenbuch (R)*	Human Flourishing Promoted, Philosophers Antonio Gramsci, Analyze Key Developments, Critical Race Theory, Social Studies Curriculum, Neo-Marxist Critical Theory, Public School Students, Discuss Topics Including, Critical Theory, Key Ideas	Education	72	Referred to Education K-16	04/07/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2803	False	03/14/2025	03/14/2025	Anti LGBT

Currently, the law defines such a business as a nightclub, bar, restaurant, or similar commercial enterprise that provides live nude entertainment for at least two people and allows on-site alcohol consumption. The bill adds a new category to this definition, including any business or commercial enterprise that engages in or hosts an activity defined as a ""sexually oriented performance"" under the Texas Penal Code. The term ""nude"" is also defined comprehensively, describing it as either being entirely unclothed or wearing clothing that leaves certain body parts (breasts for females, genitals, or buttocks) exposed or visible through less than fully opaque clothing.

AN ACT relating to the regulation of steroid use by students participating in athletic competitions sponsored or sanctioned by the University Interscholastic League.	This bill modifies the existing Education Code to clarify the circumstances under which students can use steroids in University Interscholastic League (UIL) athletic competitions. Specifically, the bill maintains the current provision that allows students to use steroids prescribed by a medical practitioner for a valid medical purpose without facing athletic ineligibility, but explicitly states that providing steroids to a minor student for the purpose of transitioning their biological sex does not constitute a valid medical purpose. The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a two-thirds vote in both legislative chambers, or otherwise will become effective on September 1, 2025. The purpose appears to be restricting the use of steroids for gender transition in minor students participating in UIL athletic competitions, potentially preventing such students from using hormone treatments that might be considered performance-enhancing or medically controversial in the context of school sports.	89th Legislature Regular Session	2	In Committee	False	6	1	0	26	2	Donna Campbell (R)*, Brandon Creighton (R)*	Athletic Competitions Sponsored, University Interscholastic League, Valid Medical Purpose, Biological Sex, Education Code, Students Participating, Minor Student, Student, Relating, Txsb	Education	46	Scheduled for public hearing on . . .	04/15/2025	03/14/2025	https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB2920	False	03/14/2025	03/15/2025	Anti LGBT
